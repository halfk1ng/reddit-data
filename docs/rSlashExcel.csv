I would divide the cost by the number of days being accounted for. And then with that per-day cost, I would make my adjustments per month. For example to get my correct Gas bill for January... My Gas Bill 12/06/19 - 01/06/20 was 320, the cost per day would be 10.3226. The days for January was 6. Therefore (10.3226 X 6 = $61.94). Then the Gas 1/06/2020 - 02/06/2020 was 160. Divide that by 31 and I get 5.1613 for price per day. Then multiple that my the remaining days in January (5.1613 X 25 = $129.03)... Then I would add both sums up. $61.94 + $129.03 = $190.97 Gas Expense for January. Anyone know how would I do this easily in excel for multiple bills that are paid in different periods?

I hold a sociology bachelor's degree, I attended a bunch of summer schools on social science research techniques and methodology, and I'm very curious. I love to explore and practice stuff. I'm very interested in strengthening my data analysis skills, so my choice is between studying Excel for Business or learning Python basics.I have a basic knowledge of Excel and zero about Python or programming in general. I have a certain grasp on calculus and statistics, even if my university courses aren't heavily focused on these subjects.Excel is a very common tool, universally present in every company, in every sector. Also easier to learn (just maybe?). The online course is 4 weeks long. Python is more complete but also complex. It could also give me the chance to access larger sets of data and automate stuff. The online course is 7 weeks long. I don't know what position I'll be looking for after university, but I aim to have as many as possible job opportunities.

The thinking behind the mechanic itself and the reasoning for the forumla to be this way is; if they become famous in a bunch places in a region, there's no reason why a town they've never visited, but have done glory worthy things in the neighbouring towns, wouldn't have heard of them.Ostensibly, what I'm try to do is:=IF (Town Fame &gt; Region Fame) Then (Town Fame = Town Fame), IF (Town Fame&lt;Region Fame x 0.80) Then (Town Fame = Region Fame x 0.80)[This is the formula I have so far](https://imgur.com/hdUqZLC), I'm guessing you can't put = in a formula.I feel like this should be simple enough, but I'm not sure the correct puntaction, functions etc. to use.

The issue is, now the adjusted 'Town Fame' numbers are represented of the old 'Region Fame' and not the new one and in turn immediately incorrect again.I ended up just repeated the process multiple times, each time getting closer to the equilibirum point, but not getting there.I don't want to have to manually do this process everytime I change 1 number, or just have a bunch of cells slowly approaching the correct answer.So my question is: Is there was a way to get the logical conclusion of this sequence, with all numbers being equal to 80% of the eventual resting number?My current Spreadsheet look likes [this](https://imgur.com/0ZGGm4I)`","`I would like help creating a IF, Then Statement to help with my DnD campaign`"

At the time I knew a couple basic formulas like SUM and AVERAGE but wasn’t familiar with anything else, including locking references or even using different sheets. My former position was an operations lead and I was basically responsible for managing outbound functions on our closing shift and making sure all the work got done. I detest micromanaging, so I had a lot of free time (and a lot of my own time) to invest in growing my skills and knowledge and Excel was the first place. When I first started turning out projects, all of which were unsolicited, I caught a lot of flak from some of my immediate superiors who began to joke my solution to every problem was another spreadsheet. Quickly I began to be solicited for projects by the higher-ups in the company; creating dashboards, long-term planning and forecasting, anything and everything involving data. Whenever a piece of data was needed the discussion eventually turned to “ask Jacobs, he probably already has it”. Now, a position for a junior supervisor has been created and I was ready to apply. I’ll be carrying on a lot of my current duties with operations but will also have more duties from an analytical aspect; in fact, this is the first time in our company there has been a position where data analysis is a major component. Don’t get me wrong, knowing Excel didn’t get me the job entirely. Having the initiative and drive to learn Excel and take it to an expert level was a big part, as well as being able to lead people. For what it’s worth though, this community helped me out quite a bit and I’m thankful. And to anyone just starting out, there really isn’t a reason to give up.

The thinking behind the mechanic itself and the reasoning for the forumla to be this way is; if they become famous in a bunch places in a region, there's no reason why a town they've never visited, but have done glory worthy things in the neighbouring towns, wouldn't have heard of them.Ostensibly, what I'm try to do is:=IF (Town Fame &gt; Region Fame) Then (Town Fame = Town Fame), IF (Town Fame&lt;Region Fame x 0.80) Then (Town Fame = Region Fame x 0.80)[This is the formula I have so far](https://imgur.com/hdUqZLC), I'm guessing you can't put = in a formula.I feel like this should be simple enough, but I'm not sure the correct puntaction, functions etc. to use.

The issue is, now the adjusted 'Town Fame' numbers are represented of the old 'Region Fame' and not the new one and in turn immediately incorrect again.I ended up just repeated the process multiple times, each time getting closer to the equilibirum point, but not getting there.I don't want to have to manually do this process everytime I change 1 number, or just have a bunch of cells slowly approaching the correct answer.So my question is: Is there was a way to get the logical conclusion of this sequence, with all numbers being equal to 80% of the eventual resting number?My current Spreadsheet look likes [this](https://imgur.com/0ZGGm4I)`","`I would like help creating a IF, Then Statement to help with my DnD campaign`"

At the time I knew a couple basic formulas like SUM and AVERAGE but wasn’t familiar with anything else, including locking references or even using different sheets. My former position was an operations lead and I was basically responsible for managing outbound functions on our closing shift and making sure all the work got done. I detest micromanaging, so I had a lot of free time (and a lot of my own time) to invest in growing my skills and knowledge and Excel was the first place. When I first started turning out projects, all of which were unsolicited, I caught a lot of flak from some of my immediate superiors who began to joke my solution to every problem was another spreadsheet. Quickly I began to be solicited for projects by the higher-ups in the company; creating dashboards, long-term planning and forecasting, anything and everything involving data. Whenever a piece of data was needed the discussion eventually turned to “ask Jacobs, he probably already has it”. Now, a position for a junior supervisor has been created and I was ready to apply. I’ll be carrying on a lot of my current duties with operations but will also have more duties from an analytical aspect; in fact, this is the first time in our company there has been a position where data analysis is a major component. Don’t get me wrong, knowing Excel didn’t get me the job entirely. Having the initiative and drive to learn Excel and take it to an expert level was a big part, as well as being able to lead people. For what it’s worth though, this community helped me out quite a bit and I’m thankful. And to anyone just starting out, there really isn’t a reason to give up.

At the time I knew a couple basic formulas like SUM and AVERAGE but wasn’t familiar with anything else, including locking references or even using different sheets. My former position was an operations lead and I was basically responsible for managing outbound functions on our closing shift and making sure all the work got done. I detest micromanaging, so I had a lot of free time (and a lot of my own time) to invest in growing my skills and knowledge and Excel was the first place. When I first started turning out projects, all of which were unsolicited, I caught a lot of flak from some of my immediate superiors who began to joke my solution to every problem was another spreadsheet. Quickly I began to be solicited for projects by the higher-ups in the company; creating dashboards, long-term planning and forecasting, anything and everything involving data. Whenever a piece of data was needed the discussion eventually turned to “ask Jacobs, he probably already has it”. Now, a position for a junior supervisor has been created and I was ready to apply.

At the time I knew a couple basic formulas like SUM and AVERAGE but wasn’t familiar with anything else, including locking references or even using different sheets. My former position was an operations lead and I was basically responsible for managing outbound functions on our closing shift and making sure all the work got done. I detest micromanaging, so I had a lot of free time (and a lot of my own time) to invest in growing my skills and knowledge and Excel was the first place. When I first started turning out projects, all of which were unsolicited, I caught a lot of flak from some of my immediate superiors who began to joke my solution to every problem was another spreadsheet. Quickly I began to be solicited for projects by the higher-ups in the company; creating dashboards, long-term planning and forecasting, anything and everything involving data. Whenever a piece of data was needed the discussion eventually turned to “ask Jacobs, he probably already has it”. Now, a position for a junior supervisor has been created and I was ready to apply.

First that the dates on 'Main Sheet' coincide with the date range of 'Month Sheet' (set at the top by row with each date being a column), then a row starting with the same text flag (ABC) and finally under each date column against the ABC text flag there will be text. I'd like that text in a cell on 'Main Sheet'.I can provide you with pictures if you want, just ask.As far as I have gotten (and this obviously doesn't work) is:=IF(INDEX(Apr!$C$4:$BL$33,MATCH(C9),MATCH(D$7,$A$6,))the Apr!$C$4:$BL$33,MATCH is the date range on 'Month Sheet'the C9 is the text flag on Main Sheet (ABC)the second MATCH (D$7,$A$6,)) is attempting to match D7 on my Main Sheet which is the date.I imagine a lot of you right now are seriously face palming! And I get that, like i said, this is like day 3 for me looking at Excel.

With the addition of the LET function, now you can!The function definition for LET works as follows:        - LET(name1, value1, [name2…], [value2…], calculation) - name1: The name for the 1st value - value1: The value to associate with the 1st name -   name2 (optional): Additional names -   value2 (optional): Additional values -   calculation: The calculation to perform. This is always the final argument and it can refer to any of the defined names in the LET.1. Readability No more having to remember what a specific range/cell reference referred to, what your calculation was doing or duplicating the same expression within a formula. With the ability to name expressions, you can give meaningful context to readers of your formula.2. Performance       If you reuse the same expression multiple times in a formula, Excel calculates that expression multiple times. LET allows you to name the expression and refer to it using that name. Any named expression is calculated only once, even if it is referred to many times in the formula. This can significantly improve performance for computationally complex expressions.Full details here:https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-let/ba-p/1233572`",`Announcing the LET() function - for assigning and using variables`

With the addition of the LET function, now you can!The function definition for LET works as follows:        - LET(name1, value1, [name2…], [value2…], calculation) - name1: The name for the 1st value - value1: The value to associate with the 1st name -   name2 (optional): Additional names -   value2 (optional): Additional values -   calculation: The calculation to perform. This is always the final argument and it can refer to any of the defined names in the LET.1. Readability No more having to remember what a specific range/cell reference referred to, what your calculation was doing or duplicating the same expression within a formula. With the ability to name expressions, you can give meaningful context to readers of your formula.2. Performance       If you reuse the same expression multiple times in a formula, Excel calculates that expression multiple times. LET allows you to name the expression and refer to it using that name. Any named expression is calculated only once, even if it is referred to many times in the formula. This can significantly improve performance for computationally complex expressions.Full details here:https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-let/ba-p/1233572`",`Announcing the LET() function - for assigning and using variables`

With the addition of the LET function, now you can!The function definition for LET works as follows:        - LET(name1, value1, [name2…], [value2…], calculation) - name1: The name for the 1st value - value1: The value to associate with the 1st name -   name2 (optional): Additional names -   value2 (optional): Additional values -   calculation: The calculation to perform. This is always the final argument and it can refer to any of the defined names in the LET.1. Readability No more having to remember what a specific range/cell reference referred to, what your calculation was doing or duplicating the same expression within a formula. With the ability to name expressions, you can give meaningful context to readers of your formula.2. Performance       If you reuse the same expression multiple times in a formula, Excel calculates that expression multiple times. LET allows you to name the expression and refer to it using that name. Any named expression is calculated only once, even if it is referred to many times in the formula. This can significantly improve performance for computationally complex expressions.Full details here:https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-let/ba-p/1233572`",`Announcing the LET() function - for assigning and using variables`

With the addition of the LET function, now you can!The function definition for LET works as follows:        - LET(name1, value1, [name2…], [value2…], calculation) - name1: The name for the 1st value - value1: The value to associate with the 1st name -   name2 (optional): Additional names -   value2 (optional): Additional values -   calculation: The calculation to perform. This is always the final argument and it can refer to any of the defined names in the LET.1. Readability No more having to remember what a specific range/cell reference referred to, what your calculation was doing or duplicating the same expression within a formula. With the ability to name expressions, you can give meaningful context to readers of your formula.2. Performance       If you reuse the same expression multiple times in a formula, Excel calculates that expression multiple times. LET allows you to name the expression and refer to it using that name. Any named expression is calculated only once, even if it is referred to many times in the formula. This can significantly improve performance for computationally complex expressions.Full details here:https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-let/ba-p/1233572`",`Announcing the LET() function - for assigning and using variables`

First a little of my background: I was trained in electrical engineering and have used Excel’s technical functions up to pivot tables/charts level. Most of the time I would just set up simple table calculations over one or up to 2-3 worksheets, something that uni students or engineers would have been familiar with.  I have seen at Excel courses that I probably already know the technical features, but I found how commercial analysts uses Excel for business analysis a bit new to me. It’s not business/commerce things like calculating the financial worth or NPV, but rather it is setting up one worksheet as key, how to separate inputs from calculations, presenting outputs in selective ways that present insights quickly, building in checksums.Does anyone know whether there are any courses or training materials available for this kind of thing? It is not things like Excel features, pivot, goal seek, VBA, and neither is it business modelling like interests calculations or NPV, but rather on packaging my model to make it communicate things quickly, easily, accurate, and easy to maintain.

First a little of my background: I was trained in electrical engineering and have used Excel’s technical functions up to pivot tables/charts level. Most of the time I would just set up simple table calculations over one or up to 2-3 worksheets, something that uni students or engineers would have been familiar with.  I have seen at Excel courses that I probably already know the technical features, but I found how commercial analysts uses Excel for business analysis a bit new to me. It’s not business/commerce things like calculating the financial worth or NPV, but rather it is setting up one worksheet as key, how to separate inputs from calculations, presenting outputs in selective ways that present insights quickly, building in checksums.Does anyone know whether there are any courses or training materials available for this kind of thing? It is not things like Excel features, pivot, goal seek, VBA, and neither is it business modelling like interests calculations or NPV, but rather on packaging my model to make it communicate things quickly, easily, accurate, and easy to maintain. I have got more free time available due to the current circumstance that everyone is through right now, and I like to make full use of it to improve my skills in using Excel to do business analysis.If you have any suggestions that will be great.

I need to apply this to a large data set and have it be automatic rather than hundreds of individual Goal Seeks.  I goal seeked to get the 149.5% premium which is the solution to the problem. Basically, I need to figure out the RevPAR by Chain Scale/Class (first column: Lux, UU, U, UM, M) for a country where I only get the total RevPAR.  But, using ""U"" (the middle Chain Scale/Class) as an anchor I can figure out the premium/discount for each Chain Scale/Class by Subcontinent, then weight by Supply and use (sum product: supply \* RevPAR by Chain Scale)/(sum supply to figure out total RevPAR for the Subcontinent.  Then, using the relationship between Total RevPAR by Subcontinent and Total RevPAR by Country PLUS the same exact premium/discount for each Chain Scale/Class as the Subcontinent has, I can figure out what all the rates should be.  The trick is, you also have to incorporate the SUPPLY by Chain Scale/ Class for the country.  The closest I got was estimating the premium/discount using only the supply data for the country and RevPAR premium/discount from the Subcontinent.  Then subtracting it (or dividing it into) from the ACTUAL Total RevPAR premium/discount (gotten by dividing ""Country Total RevPAR"" by ""Subcontinent Total RevPAR"").

I need to apply this to a large data set and have it be automatic rather than hundreds of individual Goal Seeks.  I goal seeked to get the 149.5% premium which is the solution to the problem. Basically, I need to figure out the RevPAR by Chain Scale/Class (first column: Lux, UU, U, UM, M) for a country where I only get the total RevPAR.  But, using ""U"" (the middle Chain Scale/Class) as an anchor I can figure out the premium/discount for each Chain Scale/Class by Subcontinent, then weight by Supply and use (sum product: supply \* RevPAR by Chain Scale)/(sum supply to figure out total RevPAR for the Subcontinent.  Then, using the relationship between Total RevPAR by Subcontinent and Total RevPAR by Country PLUS the same exact premium/discount for each Chain Scale/Class as the Subcontinent has, I can figure out what all the rates should be.  The trick is, you also have to incorporate the SUPPLY by Chain Scale/ Class for the country.  The closest I got was estimating the premium/discount using only the supply data for the country and RevPAR premium/discount from the Subcontinent.  Then subtracting it (or dividing it into) from the ACTUAL Total RevPAR premium/discount (gotten by dividing ""Country Total RevPAR"" by ""Subcontinent Total RevPAR"").

I would like to make a pivot table based on weeks and outstanding amount (sum) where i then can open a week, and see which suppliers should get paid what amount and if possible what invoice number.The first column includes the name of the supplier and the outstanding invoices, all text based, although excel recognizes that the ''numbers'' are stored as text and should be ''numbers''. The second column includes our number for the given outstanding invoice. the 4th column is the payment date . The last column is the code of the supplier.Arranging the pivot table based on weeks etc is not the issue. **The problem is that i am unable to sort the data in such a way that i can  create a pivot table where i can filter on supplier** and therefore when i unfold a week i get the invoice numbers rather than the suppliers name. As you can see from the picture, Our number (2nd column) is linked to their invoice number but i want it linked to the Suppliers name.

I then get the top three highest amounts and write it down in the same written template. (The one on the right starting with “Top Three Sites”.) The end result I want Excel to just be able to calculate these three highest values along with which Test it is and format it into the written format. I will be using a macro for this also. The number of total tests and therefore rows could be different. As you can see I tried to do a formula but it is connected with this current pivot table and the names of each test will be different. So this will not work with a macro. Also the top three values I need should always be in cells B5, B6, and B7 if that helps since I sort by largest to smallest after inserting pivot table! Also for reference, Test 1, 2, 3 will not always be associated with the three highest values. These are just example names I used.

I would like to make a pivot table based on weeks and outstanding amount (sum) where i then can open a week, and see which suppliers should get paid what amount and if possible what invoice number.The first column includes the name of the supplier and the outstanding invoices, all text based, although excel recognizes that the ''numbers'' are stored as text and should be ''numbers''. The second column includes our number for the given outstanding invoice. the 4th column is the payment date . The last column is the code of the supplier.Arranging the pivot table based on weeks etc is not the issue. **The problem is that i am unable to sort the data in such a way that i can  create a pivot table where i can filter on supplier** and therefore when i unfold a week i get the invoice numbers rather than the suppliers name. As you can see from the picture, Our number (2nd column) is linked to their invoice number but i want it linked to the Suppliers name.

I then get the top three highest amounts and write it down in the same written template. (The one on the right starting with “Top Three Sites”.) The end result I want Excel to just be able to calculate these three highest values along with which Test it is and format it into the written format. I will be using a macro for this also. The number of total tests and therefore rows could be different. As you can see I tried to do a formula but it is connected with this current pivot table and the names of each test will be different. So this will not work with a macro. Also the top three values I need should always be in cells B5, B6, and B7 if that helps since I sort by largest to smallest after inserting pivot table! Also for reference, Test 1, 2, 3 will not always be associated with the three highest values. These are just example names I used. So once again I need the names in the cells of column A to be noted next to its corresponding top 3 value in the written template.

I'm' trying to create the MASTERMIND game in VBA. For those who don't know the game here is an explanation: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind\_(board\_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))I'm doing the game only to be played by a user, I'm not trying to make a code to solve the game. The game is supposed to be played by forms. At the left is the ""board"", and at the right is where the user chooses the sequence to check. The 5 black textboxes at the top are where the generated code will show when the game is over. What I did was to name every textbox on the board using its column and row. Therefore the names are ""txt\_Prueba\_(Column)(Row)"" :https://preview.redd.it/nexds1n70ln41.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc888e37dc628820b1642c73271758c363b57946https://preview.redd.it/73ypsbo80ln41.png?width=1425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c014f05ac2f080dc0aafba6ec2affd5bfd2227a8The black text boxes (the solution) are also named using the columns: ""txt\_comb\_(Column)"". At the beginning of the game, a number from 1 to 8 is assigned to each of these text boxes.When the player clicks ""*comprobar secuencia""* a number from 1 to 8 is assigned to the ""txt\_Prueba\_"", depending on the color.If a number in the sequence matches with a number in the generated code, one little textbox should turn white. If the number in the sequence matches a number in the solution and also the position, one little textbox should turn black. So here begins the issueI created this code to validate the sequence, once to chosen colors are on the board. But it's not working correctly\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For ColumCod = 1 To 5&amp;#x200B;IDPista = ColumCodFor Colum = 1 To 5If Controls(""txt\_comb\_"" &amp; ColumCod) = Controls(""txt\_Prueba\_"" &amp; Colum &amp; Fila) ThenControls(""txt\_Pista\_"" &amp; Fila &amp; IDPista).BackStyle = 1Controls(""txt\_Pista\_"" &amp; Fila &amp; IDPista).BackColor = RGB(255, 255, 255)If Controls(""txt\_comb\_"" &amp; ColumCod) = Controls(""txt\_Prueba\_"" &amp; ColumCod &amp; Fila) ThenControls(""txt\_Pista\_"" &amp; Fila &amp; IDPista).BackStyle = 1Controls(""txt\_Pista\_"" &amp; Fila &amp; IDPista).BackColor = RGB(0, 0, 0)Exit ForEnd IfExit ForElseEnd IfNext ColumNext ColumCod\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(To make it clear. ColumCod, Colum, Fila, IDPista are Integer variables. Fila means Row. IDPista is an identifier for the little textboxes)For example here.https://preview.redd.it/z6j1fl9t0ln41.png?width=1452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=491af58ebbf2cb23734ea9ba2ada6a90477bdbeeThe answer is shown in the colored cells at the sheet. The first try is good, any color matches, no colored little textbox. The second and third tries are good too, the color and the position matches, black colored little text boxes. But in the fourth try, there is a white little text box that shouldn't be colored as there are only two matches, only two black should appear. The same thing happens at both the next tries. The last one is ok. I don't know what code to use to make sure that if a color already matches value and position, keep only the black little textbox.Here is another example:https://preview.redd.it/ao9tnef41ln41.png?width=1445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2267abd5e26d8430d25bc7613262e5fc22d7440bThe first three tries are ok. But in both the fourth and fifth tries, there are little white text boxes that shouldn't appear. The last try is okAs I said, I'm a beginner so maybe I'm not understanding well my code. I hope someone could help me :)Thanks!

However, the 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, which I am trying to produce via a data table, generates identical outputs. With the stochastic toggle on, I have set calculations to automatic (except data tables) and calculated via f9; I’ve tried various vba subroutines that calculate the workbook (turns off screen updating etc. and all the common procedures that speed up excel calcs); and I reduced the simulations to 1,000 but none of these fix the issue to produce the desired stochastic outputs. I was able to get a few hundred different outputs by hitting f9 rapidly for about 5 minutes straight, but the stochastic outputs never update through the entire data table. I really don’t think the file size is too large for this one data table (I have 4 other small single-variable data tables elsewhere in the workbook ~6 outputs each which all work correctly).

I'm' trying to create the MASTERMIND game in VBA. For those who don't know the game here is an explanation: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind\_(board\_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))I'm doing the game only to be played by a user, I'm not trying to make a code to solve the game. The game is supposed to be played by forms. At the left is the ""board"", and at the right is where the user chooses the sequence to check. The 5 black textboxes at the top are where the generated code will show when the game is over. What I did was to name every textbox on the board using its column and row. Therefore the names are ""txt\_Prueba\_(Column)(Row)"" :https://preview.redd.it/nexds1n70ln41.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc888e37dc628820b1642c73271758c363b57946https://preview.redd.it/73ypsbo80ln41.png?width=1425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c014f05ac2f080dc0aafba6ec2affd5bfd2227a8The black text boxes (the solution) are also named using the columns: ""txt\_comb\_(Column)"". At the beginning of the game, a number from 1 to 8 is assigned to each of these text boxes.When the player clicks ""*comprobar secuencia""* a number from 1 to 8 is assigned to the ""txt\_Prueba\_"", depending on the color.If a number in the sequence matches with a number in the generated code, one little textbox should turn white. If the number in the sequence matches a number in the solution and also the position, one little textbox should turn black. So here begins the issueI created this code to validate the sequence, once to chosen colors are on the board. But it's not working correctly\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For ColumCod = 1 To 5&amp;#x200B;IDPista = ColumCodFor Colum = 1 To 5If Controls(""txt\_comb\_"" &amp; ColumCod) = Controls(""txt\_Prueba\_"" &amp; Colum &amp; Fila) ThenControls(""txt\_Pista\_"" &amp; Fila &amp; IDPista).BackStyle = 1Controls(""txt\_Pista\_"" &amp; Fila &amp; IDPista).BackColor = RGB(255, 255, 255)If Controls(""txt\_comb\_"" &amp; ColumCod) = Controls(""txt\_Prueba\_"" &amp; ColumCod &amp; Fila) ThenControls(""txt\_Pista\_"" &amp; Fila &amp; IDPista).BackStyle = 1Controls(""txt\_Pista\_"" &amp; Fila &amp; IDPista).BackColor = RGB(0, 0, 0)Exit ForEnd IfExit ForElseEnd IfNext ColumNext ColumCod\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(To make it clear. ColumCod, Colum, Fila, IDPista are Integer variables. Fila means Row. IDPista is an identifier for the little textboxes)For example here.https://preview.redd.it/z6j1fl9t0ln41.png?width=1452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=491af58ebbf2cb23734ea9ba2ada6a90477bdbeeThe answer is shown in the colored cells at the sheet. The first try is good, any color matches, no colored little textbox. The second and third tries are good too, the color and the position matches, black colored little text boxes. But in the fourth try, there is a white little text box that shouldn't be colored as there are only two matches, only two black should appear. The same thing happens at both the next tries. The last one is ok. I don't know what code to use to make sure that if a color already matches value and position, keep only the black little textbox.Here is another example:https://preview.redd.it/ao9tnef41ln41.png?width=1445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2267abd5e26d8430d25bc7613262e5fc22d7440bThe first three tries are ok.

The last try is okAs I said, I'm a beginner so maybe I'm not understanding well my code. I hope someone could help me :)Thanks!

However, the 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, which I am trying to produce via a data table, generates identical outputs. With the stochastic toggle on, I have set calculations to automatic (except data tables) and calculated via f9; I’ve tried various vba subroutines that calculate the workbook (turns off screen updating etc. and all the common procedures that speed up excel calcs); and I reduced the simulations to 1,000 but none of these fix the issue to produce the desired stochastic outputs. I was able to get a few hundred different outputs by hitting f9 rapidly for about 5 minutes straight, but the stochastic outputs never update through the entire data table.

I know how to do this with other tools, but I have to use MS Office. I am unsure if DOS scripts will run without admin privileges, or if they are needed (Linux user.) The two given Excel sheets are independent documents. The first (Figure 2) has sheets by date (3rd March, 4th March, etc.), the second Excel document (Figure 3) has sheets by month.My question is either to have help immediately in the process, or for you to point me to the relevant reading such that I can suss this out myself; I've no idea the terms to use for half of the operations. The CSV file looks as in Figure 1 (recreated in Org, I was emphatically not allowed to use the actual CSV file or even an obfuscated screenshot of it) once imported as text into an empty excel sheet. Foobar, foo, and bar represent irrelevant noise. Integers and non-integers are noted, because they must remain so during transfer (ie. no rounding). As can be seen, some of the columns are in the 'incorrect' place; the integers in the third column should be under 'size' in the first half, and the non-integers under Foobar should actually be under Amount in the first half. In the second half, all is corrected.The data from the Size column then need to be moved into the Excel sheet shown in Figure 2. The row corresponding to 23h-1d in Figure 1 goes into the 1DAY row in Figure 2, and 1DAY-2DAY is fed into by everything between 1 and 2 days in Figure 1. Cell 3C contains the formula =SUM(B3/B37\*100) where B37 is the sum of all integers in B. I've then been manually dragging down to redo the math for all cells in column C. Then we have Figure 3, which contains all data for the month. I'll start with half one, then half two.For half one, from Sunday-Friday, the Amount data (wrongly under foobar for the first half of Figure 1) feeds into Revenue boxes for the relevant date, with everything feeding in as expected, but the sum being calculated for anything five hours+. For Saturdays, it is the same, but with the amounts done in two hourly blocks. The the second half, we again use the Size data from Figure 1, and all is the same deal as for the first half, but we are operating with integers here. Can this all be done with a macro? Should I learn some VBA, or does it require a DOS script?

I know how to do this with other tools, but I have to use MS Office. I am unsure if DOS scripts will run without admin privileges, or if they are needed (Linux user.) The two given Excel sheets are independent documents. The first (Figure 2) has sheets by date (3rd March, 4th March, etc.), the second Excel document (Figure 3) has sheets by month.My question is either to have help immediately in the process, or for you to point me to the relevant reading such that I can suss this out myself; I've no idea the terms to use for half of the operations. The CSV file looks as in Figure 1 (recreated in Org, I was emphatically not allowed to use the actual CSV file or even an obfuscated screenshot of it) once imported as text into an empty excel sheet. Foobar, foo, and bar represent irrelevant noise. Integers and non-integers are noted, because they must remain so during transfer (ie. no rounding). As can be seen, some of the columns are in the 'incorrect' place; the integers in the third column should be under 'size' in the first half, and the non-integers under Foobar should actually be under Amount in the first half. In the second half, all is corrected.The data from the Size column then need to be moved into the Excel sheet shown in Figure 2. The row corresponding to 23h-1d in Figure 1 goes into the 1DAY row in Figure 2, and 1DAY-2DAY is fed into by everything between 1 and 2 days in Figure 1. Cell 3C contains the formula =SUM(B3/B37\*100) where B37 is the sum of all integers in B. I've then been manually dragging down to redo the math for all cells in column C. Then we have Figure 3, which contains all data for the month. I'll start with half one, then half two.For half one, from Sunday-Friday, the Amount data (wrongly under foobar for the first half of Figure 1) feeds into Revenue boxes for the relevant date, with everything feeding in as expected, but the sum being calculated for anything five hours+. For Saturdays, it is the same, but with the amounts done in two hourly blocks. The the second half, we again use the Size data from Figure 1, and all is the same deal as for the first half, but we are operating with integers here. Can this all be done with a macro? Should I learn some VBA, or does it require a DOS script? What relevant documentation am I best to read?Thank you for your patience and for reading, I will endavour to provide any further information required to help.

I've got a project with a bunch of steps in Power Query to come to a most-of-the-information-needed chunk of data which is then turned into a pivot table for review.The only missing component is there is extra information that needs to be manually entered on an irregular basis based on irregular factors. (Vendors, periods of time, dollar amount, etc.) Without breaking down the rest of the math, I figured that before the final step (data that the pivot table is based on), I could branch a table out from all that data but only have the vendors/years/period columns, then manually add the dollar amount columns beside that connected table, insert the necessary data accordingly, then merge that result back into the Power Query ""chain"" for the pivot table to then use.That worked fine during the first time I did it. However, when I refreshed the data lately all the extra columns I added to the connected table disappeared. I'm not surprised by that (clearly the tab completely refreshes, now knowing) but am wondering what solution -does- exist.Considering most of this data will be manually entered, I am -really- trying to use this hypothetical table as a tab in the workbook instead of connecting more external data and merging that way. One of the biggest reasons is to stay organized, plus avoids incompatible data due to mismatched vendor names &amp; numbers, etc.Important too is that if there are new vendors created or new periods in the year as time goes on the aforementioned ""editable table"" would simply append the new lines without scrubbing out all the previous work. I need to figure out how to auto-sort the table after that, but right now I need the table to simply be stable first.I hope I'm explaining it clearly and can have a lead or three about how to pull this off.

I believe this is a better way of learning instead of just looking at random guides. Since I have an interest in both a small sport called floorball and also statistics I have decided  that my next project should include both of these! Since this will probably be my biggest project so far in my excel career I thought I’d ask for some starting help regarding the layout. What I want to be able to do is to write the matchups in the coming weekend and based on that see the probability of total goals in the game, total goals for each team and the probability for different winning margins. I want these calculations to be based on multiple criteria:- each teams stats for the current season and previous seasons in total- each teams current form, 5 and 10 last games played- each teams stats for both home and away fixtures- the stats for the latest meetings between those 2 teamsI’ll of course have to decide how the different criteria should be weighted in the calculation but what I am asking for ideas about is the layout of the workbook.I am currently thinking of having :- one sheet where all the game results are (maybe I can import them somehow from a website)- One sheet for each team with all their statistics and the statistics vs each opponent- one Main sheet where I use some sort of vlookup/index match to write the team names and get the probabilities. Would you have done it differently? Where would you start? I would love to hear your opinions!

Basically, I have a large data set (75,000 line items) in which a single ""Activity"" has an investment amount associated with it.

My end goal is to create a pivot table that I can summarize with filters by some of my additional columns but show the ROI based on investment and return based on those filters, such as products sold.  However, when my pivot table filters on product sold ""ring"", it will sum the returns which is accurate, but it will also sum the investment column which is not accurate.  The investment should only be counted once per activity.  How can I get the pivot table data to only count the investment once per activity but still sum the return column accurately?  The only way I've been able to do this so far is to create a pivot table to get my return totals, export the pivot table data, remove duplicates based on activity number, then sum investments and create a separate table to display return, investment, and calculated ROI.

To estimate our level of effort for the project, we use a matrix-style Excel sheet, where rows are tasks and columns are staff. We enter the hours of effort into the body of the matrix, which can then be used to calculate cost by task and subtask. See attached example file. Currently, someone takes a shot at building the work breakdown structure based on the Scope of Work, then there's all sorts of rounds of edits based on input from other people. What inevitably results is someone break a subtotal formula or stomps over a formula and breaks the sheet when trying to make changes, like add more tasks or delete tasks. Ideally, the sheet would allow users unfamiliar with the formulas to add/remove staff and add/remove tasks and subtasks in the work breakdown structure. Just locking down the file and only allowing one person to make changes in structure has been similarly inefficient as fixing errors at the end. **Questions:**  *  Is Excel the right tool for this, or is there another better existing solution out there? *  Is custom VBA what I need?

So people plays up to 45 cards and run only 1 copy of the card they don't want to see.* Some strategies are dedicated to 60-cards decks* Some cards allows you to search your critical cards, they are considered as equivalentSo, what I would is an Excel file where I enter my list of cards, and then I can generate 100 opening hands (100 combinations of 5 OR 6 random cards from the 40-60 list) to see the amount of good hands and bad hands.To determine the quality of the opening hand:* You have 2, 3, 4 or 5 cards combinations.

Now I've been left to my own accord to make my previous work future proof and easily managed. This was my first project on Excel and I've had no experience on it so what I've done, I've taught myself in the last 2 weeks. Heads up, there is a lot of info before we get to the question at hand so I appreciate you taking the time to read it in advance.I'm faced with an issue that I don't even know is rectified by my idea, and if it it's at all possible, how to enter it.To explain what I'm tasked with:I am to design a spreadsheet which will automatically generate sentences based on previous entries so I'm using IF queries. The idea is that the text for the question is pulled from one single cell, ideally on another sheet, rather than cascading the formula down and having a massive mess hidden somewhere way off to the sides in the sheet. This sheet would then be easily managed/updated so that rather than updating say 200 fields by updating 1 on sheet 1 and then dragging it all the way down, I just update the one cell on sheet 2.So, in sheet 1, simply put, if a cell = Yes, then pull through the data from a cell in sheet 2 but the issue, is that the cell in sheet 2 goes ""How can I view \*Cell from sheet 1\* in the results grid?"". As \*Cell from sheet 1\* is going to have a different value depending on what column I'm working on this is where my issue starts to develop. In my head I think, just have the sentence in sheet to say ""How can I view \*Cell from sheet 1\*"" and then in sheet 1 be =IF(CellFromSheet1=""Yes"",CellFromSheet2 &amp; ""in the results grid?"",Doesn'tMatter). But then, it kind of defeats the point of having sheet 2 as if I need to change ""in the results in the grid?"" I need to update all of the row in sheet 2.Can I ask it to say ""How can I view \*VariableCellInSheet1\* in the results grid?""? Or am I going about this the wrong way?Remember, I am a complete Excel novice so I apologise if I've butchered the explanation, but I've just spent half an hour trying to figure out what the issue is in my head so I can somehow get it out and ask the question.I'll do my best to answer any follow up questions, but remember, novice over here.TIA`",`Can't figure out how to reliably and consistently reference a series of cells.`

I'll figure something out, but in the meantime, if there are alternatives to this, please feel free to share.So, I'm not savvy in Excel in the least. I understand terms; however, I haven't begun to unravel the metaphorical beast that is Excel.Here's my, or better yet, my work's problem: As the title suggests, we use this Excel program (daily) and the continuity is gone. It's been gone for years and the person who's currently the lead on our team (who also doesn't know anything about the innerworkings of the program) is leaving at the end of May. So the responsibility of it will soon fall flat on my coworkers (2) and I. This program eludes us. Basically, we open the Excel program and a small window pops up. This window allows us to link several file locations for .PDFs. Some already have predesignated *titles* that are for specific files, while others are blank titles that can be filled in.Once the files are linked via the file path, we click ""Create Readbook"" and it compiles all of the .PDFs into a PowerPoint. This PowerPoint creates a coversheet as well as a Table of Contents, which link the titles to their respective .PDFs, and at the bottom of each page are bookmarks that do the same.Once the PowerPoint is finished building from the program, we save it as its own .PDF.*So, the problem lies with the fact that: 1. No one knows how to modify it. 2. If it breaks, our capability falls to 0% immediately, which I guess was never addressed in the past--or was largely ignored. 3. I can't find a template of said program. If there's, for a lack of a better term, 'coding' involved, no one knows what to do.*Thank you.`","`At work, we use an Excel Program that compiles several PDFs into a PowerPoint (which we then save as into its own bigger .PDF).

As part of this, I have to sift through data organized in G-sheets, entered by one of our logistics managers. I have only been provided the Starting &amp; Ending zip codes, and realized in order to make sense of this, I need mileage between locations. I had basically three options:**1.)** Get our IT admin to approve purchasing API access to Google Maps, and elevate my permissions to allow for running Python/JS queries from within Excel (our anti-malware software blocks this.)**2.)** Manually enter each zip code into Google Maps, and type out the # of miles into each cell, which could take forever.**3.)** Create a script that will navigate to Google Maps using Internet Explorer, search the HTML code for the # of miles, and paste that value into Excel.I opted to go with option 3 since it was the quickest and cheapest option to get the information I needed. I wanted to share this script with the /r/Excel community in case someone out there in the future needs to find distances without paying for a service, or doing 1 at a time.**Notes**1.) You'll need to create references to a few different libraries within your workbook:**Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library**,**Microsoft Internet Controls** and **Microsoft HTML Object Library**2.) This script essentially scrapes the HTML code from the Google Maps navigation page. If in the event Google decides to update their source code, this could cause the macro to stop working properly.3.) You can use Zip Codes, Addresses, Cities, States, or Coordinates as your input values.4.) Because Excel truncates numbers starting with 0, the macro is written to add a 0 to the start of any zip code with &lt; 5 digits (mostly in the state of NJ)**How it works**1.) You'll first highlight the cells you want to insert the Miles into, then run this macro.2.) You'll be given two prompts, first one is to select the column containing your Starting Location (you can select either the column or an individual cell, doesn't matter). Then the same thing for your Destination Location.3.) Excel will do its thing, and within 5-10 seconds, you should see the distance in miles populated in your highlighted cell.I have tested this macro and it seems to work 95% of the time.

So far, so good.Now the Problem: The IDs that I enter in the other sheets dont excatly match the ones in master. the only difference is at the end of the ID (which can be different in length).

You can use the linux command snmpwalk to get OIDs that are required for the monitoring. You can basically ""ask"" a snmp device (like a switch, router, printer, etc) for the value to an OID. The problem is that each device has hundreds if not thousand to tens of thousand of these OIDs. There is a database where you can enter OIDs to get a descripiton of what value they contain. These OIDs also contain tables. The problem with these tables is that each device can have a different index in the table. That means that different devices may have a few differences at the end of the OID. This is the reason I cant use exact lookup.Now Im trying to build a master table containing all OIDs I come across with their description. Now whenever I want to start monitoring a new device type I want to paste the OIDs I get from snmpwalk into a new sheet, apply my forumla and it pulls all data I already indexed from master. As I said earlier these OIDs might be a little different at the end as different devices index the tables in the OID differently (Some start at 1 others at 1000, they also have different lengths, but they always seem to increment the last digit).&amp;#x200B;[part of master table](https://preview.redd.it/qkgv8h0sp8j41.png?width=1553&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e6284e31d49593f6536c3d6b786db584f226b26)The other tables look the same.

f7kfot,2598,2/22/2020,Show and Tell,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/f7kfot/this_post_will_save_you_hours_of_formula/,"`Hello,I wanna give this advice for everyone to use because I need visibility for a question. By reading this post you'll face the same need than I do and so we'll be more likely to find answer to that issue.&amp;#x200B;**Imagine you wanna correct the same mistake on a formula spread on more than a 100 files.**The fastest way to do it (but you need to anticipate) is to use this circuit of formula :* **The FORMULATEXT** *(The function transform the formula of a cell as a text)* \*\*formula (This function doesn't work properly so I used a User Defined Function (=DisplayFormula) wich does the EXACT same thing, here's the VBA Code if you're interested :Function Text\_Of\_Formula(rng As Range) As String&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Application.VolatileText\_Of\_Formula = rng.Formula&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;End Function&amp;#x200B;* **The EVALUATE Formula** *(The function execute a formula written as text)* \*\*This function is note availabe anymore on Excel.

He has all the formulas but he has no datas. He's unique and sons-files are based on his model but with a database.The sons-files are many, each son-files has it's unique database but it uses the exact same formula as the father-file. To portray it simply we have :|1 Father File|100 Sons Files|1 Result file||:-|:-|:-||Calculations|100 Differents Databases|100 Differents Results|&amp;#x200B;*We will take the cell*  \*\*=\[Father.xlslx\]Calculation'!\*\****A1*** *as the core of this example. The cell is abstract and solely for the purpose of this example.** \*File Structure :\*Father has  tabs :1. Calculation'! (Wich contains the formulas)2. Database'! (Wich is empty because it's filled only on sons-files)3. Formula Updatingprocess'! (Wich contains the formulas as text)**Since the son files are based on father model, they have exactly the same structure.**&amp;#x200B;**=\[Father.xlslx\]Calculation'! A1 has for formula =ROUNDUP(DataBase'!A1;A)** *(It has a syntax error, the A should be a number as =ROUNDUP has for argument =ROUNDUP(Number;No\_Number)*And this Syntax error is on every son-files as the son files are based on Father-files.|1 Father File|100 Son files|1 Result file||:-|:-|:-||1 Mistake in formula|100 Mistakes in formula|100 Mistakes|**Now how to correct these 100 mistakes WITHOUT HAVING TO COPY PASTE THE RIGHT FORMULA 100 TIMES.**Well spoiler, I don't know how to ,but to prevent this kind of situation ever happening again, what you can do is centralize all your formulas into one main file, that way when you change the formula of this one main file, every linked file are automatically corrected. This is basically like when your game does an update.Let's say Fortnite does an update since it seems they do them every seconds. They don't fix the game on EACH of their computer player. No, they just correct their version and your version of the game aligns herself to the new one.**We're trying to do the exact same thing here. To do so you need to :**1. Transform through the =DisplayFormula(A1) all the father formulas as string of text.2. Transfer dynamically the strings of text obained and share it on the son files (To make it simple, if you have the function DisplayFormula(A1) in B2, then you press = and click on B2. That way you store all the formulas as text on the son files wich are dynamically linked to the father file. That way if you change let's say you change from**Just to remember :Calculation'!A1=ROUNDUP(DataBase'!48;A)** and**Formula Updatingprocess'!B2=DisplayFormula(A1)**|Before correction in A1 on Father-file|After correction in A1on Father-file||:-|:-||A1=ROUNDUP(Calculation'!48;A)|A1=ROUNDUP(Calculation'!48;0)||A1=#N\\A|A1=48|Then you have on **Formula Updatingprocess'!B2**|Before correction in A1 on Father-file|After correction in A1on Father-file||:-|:-||B2=DisplayFormula(A1)|B2=DisplayFormula(A1)||**B2='*****=ROUNDUP(DataBase'!48;A)*** *(This is a TEXT, it's not a Formula, it's the same as if you're write ""Color"" in an empty cell****, just text)***|**B2=*****=ROUNDUP(DataBase'!48;0)****(This is a TEXT, it's not a Formula, it's the same as if you're write ""Color"" in an empty cell****, just text)***|**Now all you have to do is execute those said formula wich are contained as text on the son files.**&amp;#x200B;|Before correction in A1 on the son file|After correction on the son file A1||:-|:-||**=EVALUATE(\[Father.xlslx\]Formula Updatingprocess'!B2)**|**=EVALUATE(\[Father.xlslx\]Formula Updatingprocess'!B2)**||\*\*=EVALUATE(\*\****=ROUNDUP(DataBase'!48;A)*** *(The formula Interpret the text contained in \[Father.xlslx\]Formula Updatingprocess'!B2) wich is '=ROUNDUP(DataBase'!48;A) as formula and runs it as)*|\*\*=EVALUATE(\*\****=ROUNDUP(DataBase'!48;0)****(The formula Interpret the text contained in \[Father.xlslx\]Formula Updatingprocess'!B2) wich is '=ROUNDUP(DataBase'!48;A) as formula and runs it as)*||=#N/A|=48|&amp;#x200B;Well I hope it helps you in the futur as I took time to make it.

And to thank users here that answer Excel questions without asking for anything except clippy points lol.I started learning Excel way back in 2015 to make a career shift. It was also because of a comment in an /r/askreddit thread that mentioned Excel as one of the most useful and common tools used in the office. I learned about it through watching youtube tutorials, practicing and creating my own tables, etc.I managed to secure a reporting related job in 2015. Then I got wind of 'VBA' which lets you automate processes in Excel. I also tried to learn it via watching youtube tutorials. This is my gateway to the world of programming. I improved my VBA skills by practicing on my work by automating tedious and manual tasks. After a year, I got promoted.I realized that I am having fun programming with VBA so I tried to enter the world of *freelancing* as a VBA developer. This is on top of my full-time job. My skills in writing VBA code improved a lot due to freelancing. I met a lot of different clients with different business needs which I am thankful for. I also managed to save a lot of money because of this additional source of income. I continued doing this freelancing gig up to the present (managed to buy a used car because of this lol).Then after a year from being promoted, I applied for a Business Analyst position. I was known as the *excel guy* on the team. I mainly handled excel automation and RPA projects because of this. Then after 8-9 months, I applied as a developer within the same team.My only background in programming is Excel VBA (but i tried to learn the basics of SQL, Python and Java) but after 2 years working as a Dev, I managed to learn about web development languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery). Then finally this year, I decided to jump to another company because of compensation reasons. I landed a job as a 'VBA developer'. They offered me +122% of my current salary which is huuuuge! Im really happy and excited about it.I still have a lot of things to learn regarding Excel especially the power query part, data modeling and some VBA coding. But I am really happy that i decided to learn Excel way back in 2015.

I'm looking to automate this process.So this is the crux of what I'm trying to accomplish - I imagine I'll need some VBA for this one (or power query? Python? I'm not sure.):1. Monitor email based on email subject name (it's a Gmail address if this is important. Normally I monitor this inbox on my phone or though Chrome, but can set up the account in Outlook if that's easier).2. When email received, automatically click the ""Download"" link to download the .xlsx file.3. Open .xlsx file, and copy one row of data.4. Append row of data into locally stored .xlsx file.5. Save local .xslx file.6. Delete email (Optional).Does anyone know of a guide to accomplish something similar to this? I'm not looking to be spoon-fed a solution to my exact situation, just to be pointed towards a guide that accomplishes something similar such that I can implement it myself - happy to get my hands dirty and hopefully learn something useful while I'm at it.Thanks!&amp;#x200B;Edit: I should add, I have no experience with VBA.

On this sheet, if the first 5 columns are from the Query from table ENTER, the next 5-10 columns are manually added on (so the table expands but they're not part of the Query), that include formulas which show % margins and other figures based on what retail price is entered.The key here is that the in-column formulas update in real time, rather than on Query refresh.The issue I'm finding is that I enter retail prices on the second sheet in the right rows. I go back to ENTER and add some extra rows at the bottom (we never need to delete old rows, we only add rows at the bottom for each new day), then refresh the PRICE query so it updates.On refresh, the retail prices I entered get shifted to different rows.

But, I also want the following formulas:* A formula to spit out a number of overlaps. For example, in the table above we have 1 overlap where we see a ""1"" value in both columns. * A formula that treats an individual as matching the ""criteria"" whether or not one or both of the sources verify it. The formula would spit out the number of those individuals. For example, in the table above we have 4 individuals who have had the criteria verified with *at least one* of the two sources. I know the formula will require an IF statement, but I've tried for a while now and haven't been able to get it to work without spitting out an incorrect number (I know the number with my limited analysis and have been using it to verify the results of my formula) or getting an error.

I currently have about 10 months of data in a mysql database which you can see the structure of here: https://i.imgur.com/dTBEmAm.jpgAt first I used this google sheet &amp; form for about 8 months: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/53ktyv/budget_spreadsheet_with_google_form_for_tracking/ and then I realized I was giving google all of my financial data and storing it in the cloud, which I'm not comfortable with. It did work fine however, and was close to what I'm currently looking for. Q: Why not just download that google sheet and use it in excel? A: I have subcategories as well now, and I'm looking to use this as a project to learn excel for both personal and professional use so building my own is likely going to be the route I go.After realizing google had all of that data, I instead wrote my own expense tracking solution in php/mysql and moved all the income/expense data there as well. This solution isn't working for me as I don't have (or know of) an easy way to visualize and graph the data in the database. The submission of data part of it is fine, but I want to easily be able to see that my spending on X category is down this month, for example. I haven't found anything open source or reasonably priced to do this yet, but I'm thinking excel might just work.Currently my workflow for adding an expense is I put whatever I've purchased and the amount in a Standard Notes (google keep alternative) note, and then when I'm at my computer I add the entries that are there to my database. I do the same for my income - how much it was, what taxes were taken out, the date, and things like that. This part of my workflow is fine.I have a few questions though:Is there a way to create expense/income forms to input the data into a row automatically?

And there’s a lot of people who need calculations on working days. I really like Alberto Ferrari’s way of handling working days in Power Pivot. To quote him: “The main idea is to assign an incremental number, to each date, that increases by 1 only on working days and remains the same over holidays.”You can calculate the number of working days by simply substracting these numbers. The beauty of it is that it allows you compute the next working day from both working and non working days. So this is perfect when you want to find out stuff like:* average number of days from order to shipment* number of calls returned within 3 working daysAlberto Ferrari's classic article on how to archive this in Power Pivot: [https://www.sqlbi.com/blog/alberto/2011/01/19/working-days-computation-in-powerpivot/](https://www.sqlbi.com/blog/alberto/2011/01/19/working-days-computation-in-powerpivot/)A great read, but I want that column in a generated calendar in Power Query, not Power Pivot.

Time to share!**In short*** create a table of continuous dates* merge with a table of holidays* create a weekday number column* calculate columns with zeros and ones for weekend days and holidays and calculate a column with 1 for working days and 0 for non working days* group to tables on the working day values, resulting in two tables, one with working day, one with non working days* put a index to those two tables* expand the tables back into one table* remove the index number from the non working days, resulting in a column with index numbers and gaps on the non working days* fill down the gaps so non working days get the same value as the previous working day**In detail**I like having my parameters in plain sight, so the first step is to create a fresh Excel Workbook. Create a named table called ParameterTable with 2 columns and 3 rows. The first column has a header ‘Parameter’, the second column had a header ‘Value’. Put some descriptive labels in the first column (I suggest ‘Start Date’ and ‘End Date’). Now put a start date and an end date in the second column.

I have a workbook where I create a new sheet every week, and each week I carry over comments relating to the row.  There are two columns, one for previous comments and one for new comments.  The formula will check if there are any new comments and supersede any previous comments with those, and if not then it will carry over the previous comments.  If no data is found in new comments, and if any values are 0 from previous sheet formulas, blank is returned.  This is nested inside an IFERROR for the cases where there are any new entries that fail the lookup.  The new comments will be written text, while the previous comments will contain the formula. This enables me to type over any text in the new comments column so the comments are carried over the following week.I have a previous version of the formula which requires me to update the sheet reference the following week as this is easier to look at, as follows (column T being new comments, column U being previous comments):  `=IFERROR(IF(XLOOKUP(A6,'20200105'!A:A,'20200105'!T:T)=0,``IF(XLOOKUP(A6,'20200105'!A:A,'20200105'!U:U)=0,"""",``XLOOKUP(A6,'20200105'!A:A,'20200105'!U:U)),``XLOOKUP(A6,'20200105'!A:A,'20200105'!T:T)),"""")`This works perfectly for my case but the reason I ask for a way to simplify this is due to a dynamic version that I have created.  This includes the use of a function defined SHEETNAME that obtains the name of the active sheet.  This way, when I create a new sheet, all I need to do is rename it using a reverse date format (yyyymmdd, as per above formula) which also has the added benefit of dynamically obtaining and sorting the data I need for the date format I use to name my sheets.

Essentially, cell C1  should default to ""normal shift"" as long as A1 is Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri; otherwise it should be blank.One issue is that the cell (C1) also has data validation applied, and needs to be changeable to reflect a variety of nonstandard shifts, which are in dropdown form.Second possible issue is that the workbook is stored on Sharepoint.

It sped up work so I can actually do other more important things. I would input the data on Excel, then after clicking some button, the same data is also entered on the Word form. This Word file would then be attached and emailed to the recipient, and then a cover page would print from the printer. The file name is also important and must contain the name and case number, which also needs to be the email subject.Unfortunately, they added some fields to the form, so now I can’t use it any more to automate this task. If I knew how to read code, maybe I just need to change it so I can add the additional fields? Also instead of printing just a cover page, I’d like to actually print the Word form.

Since, with spreadsheets, data is strewn across multiple Excel files, culling reports is more difficult than using a database, which is especially true if you're dealing with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets. I'm really curious why this phenomenon keeps happening - especially in medium to large companies. IMHO, a database like Access has the following advantages:    1. Easier to secure &amp; backup data    2. Easier to create reports that would normally involve multiple spreadsheets     3. Data based on specific report criteria can be easily exported to Excel for data analysis that's better performed in Excel     4. Data can be created in Excel and then easily imported into Access So I'm asking the Excel gurus out there to help me understand why this is happening.`",`Why companies use &amp; abuse Excel instead of using an Access database`

I'm looking forward some advice:I'm using information from a database to follow the progress on diverse projects. So far so good, but I have stumbled with some issues that I would like your advice.First, and as I previously said, I pick up the rows from a data base that I have imported on excel. These data contains a lot of information from the stage a product is, to make it simply lets say that there is only 3 stages that are mostly successive: DQ (Design Qualification), PQ (Performance Qualification) and CV (Continuous Verification). Each one of this stages have at the same time their own phases, but that is for later. The thing is, sometimes, there is a change on a product and then goes back to the first stage. Because what I was trying to account with excel is the progress of each product, marking if it was on DQ, PQ or CV, when this happens it messes the way I was counting the progress (by some conditionals), because I don't want to lose all the data relevant to the work previously done, and also because the data comes from the database. I could check manually, but the idea of using the database was to automatice this.So, do you think of something to keep all the information of the old progress, and at the same time reflect the status of the new one, by, at the same time working with the database?Thanks!

So for example find SmithA in column A and verify that SmithA has ""212038.0001"" AND ""Case Lead"" matched but then also find that SmithA is further down the list and has ""216731.0003"" and ""Partner"" matched.I tried to use a helper column to combine the B and C cells and the F and G cells then use Vlookup to find the name and look for the helper cells result.

There are lots of ""band-aid"" formulas (left/right/len etc.).I'd like to make it easier on the team to mimic my reporting and give them some tips/tricks, and formulas to use.

In this Information age, excel makes sense for calculating large amounts of data simple. Excel is a part of Microsoft office. Over the years there is much software designed to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data. But Microsoft Excel still remains the most efficient tool if the person has to make sense out of data. In this blog, we have accumulated all the vital information about excel top 10 formula.Also, we add some additional information, such as importance and tips for the beginner. Many beginners waste time by typing formula manually. Just learn this 10 formula and you will be able to work with your excel sheet efficiently.A lot to know a lot to discuss, let’s get started.### Most Used Excel top 10 formulaExcel offers 500+ functions but for a regular person or for a corporate person all the functions are not useful. Definitely every function has used for a specific case. But we are left with 10 functions that truly matters to everyone regardless of which profession you are.### 1. Count, Sum, Average:-These are some of the most useful commands in excel. Everyone who sees a spreadsheet knows while working this visual information person need these command very often and these are some of the basic mathematics formulas.These basic formulas are so important that they made at the top of this excel top 10 formula list.**COUNTING OF CELL(Count, Counta).****Count:**  This command is useful when the user wants to count the number of cells that contain numeric values.**{image}****Command keyword:** **Count(2,3)** **=** This command will give the number of values in the brackets. For example, in Count(2,3) there are only two values. This command only works with numbers. This command will only work for numeric values.**Count(B1, B2, B3…)** **=** This command will give the number of the cells having a numeric value from selected cells specified in the bracket. It will not count the empty cells. This command only works with numbers.**Count(B1: B8)** **=** This command will provide the number of values in the range of cells starting from B1, B2, B3…till B8. For example in “Count(B1: B8)” the computer will count the number of cells that contain any value it will not count empty cells.**COUNTA(B1: B10) =**This command is useful when a user wants to count the number of non-empty cells in a range. This command works with numeric as well as alphabetical or any character. Besides, this command can also be used in these formats for examples such as Counta(B1, B2,…) or Counta(B1: B10) and Counta(2,4,6).1. **Submission of the cells(SUM).**This command performs an addition between selected cells or a range of cells. this command is only for numerical values. this command can be used in any format for example SUM(2,3) or SUM(B1, A5) and SUM(B2: B9).&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/nk8prp068gd41.png?width=887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=233966661c9937a2959bd1cc953ade2e05e28de1 **SUM(2,3):** Sum of numbers specified in the bracket.**SUM(A1, B2, C5…):** Addition between selected cells only.**SUM(C1: C9):** Addition in the range of cells.1. **Average:-** As its name suggests it provides us with the average of the input numbers. It only calculates an average of the numerical value.### 2. IF statementThis command is used for conditional output. Using this user can take any output from the computer according to the requirement. **Command keyword=** IF(logical, output if logic is true, output if logic is false).Let’s suppose an example that a company took a target to increase its turnover in a year then the management can follow strict rules in order to meet the target. They can monitor themselves through an excel sheet using a command like IF(turnover&gt;100cr. Turnover achieved, Turnover not achieved).Then by the end of the year/session, the excel sheet will remind output about the turnover achieved or turnover not achieved.If command very important role and many functions can be performed through it. The importance is so huge that it made on the 2nd position of our excel top 10 formula. ### 3. SUMIF, COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF.These commands are useful for the user when you want to put a condition on some of the basic commands like adding the data if the condition is fulfilled. Count the data if the condition gets fulfilled, Take an average of the data if the condition is true.**{image}****Command Keyword:** SUMIF(Range, Criteria, {Sum\_range}), COUNTIF(Range, Criteria), AVERAGEIF(Range, criteria)Furthermore, these conditional commands are very useful so 3rd Position in our excel top 10 formulas.### 4. VLOOKUP &amp; HLOOKUPAs the name of this command it allows users to lookup for a value in an array. In VLOOKUP ‘V’ stands for vertical lookup. Similarly, in HLOOKUP H stands for horizontal. Basically in these commands we lookup for the values in an array.**Command Keyword:-** VLOOKUP(lookup value, table array, column index number, range lookup).And HLOOKUP((lookup value, table array, row index number, range lookup ).So these are formulas that will provide you flexibility in the excel sheet. This command made it on the 4th position on our list of excel top 10 formula. ### 5. ConcatenateThis command is used to combine the characters of two different cells. This is applicable when we have to combine first name, last name and combining addresses from a huge datasheet.**{image, gif}****Command Keyword:** CONCATENATE(text1, text2, text3…).### 6. MAX and MINAs the name suggests, the main function of both the commands is to search for the maximum value in a huge table, and the minimum value in a huge table.**{image,gif}****Command Keyword: ‘**MAX(select range)’ and ‘MIN(select range)’.### 7. ANDThis is one very useful function. The user can use this function to check if any condition is true or false. There could more than one condition.**{image,gif}****Command Keyword:** AND(logic 1, logic 2,…).For example, AND(A1=”GOOD”,C3&gt;5) output would be TRUE if A1 is GOOD and the value of C3 is greater than 5.### 8. PROPERThis command is useful when you have huge data which is oddly formatted. if a cell has “tiMe iS moNeY” clearly the sentence needs formatting. so the user can use the proper command, for example, =PROPER(cell\_number) and it would output a well-formatted sentence in the cell.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/f8px0a6b8gd41.jpg?width=631&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a64869780151d6b6267aff65a2449dc005e9d82c**Command keyword:** PROPER(cell no1., cell no2…), or PROPER(cel no1: cell no10).### 9.Conditional formattingThis command is useful if the user wants to format things with the condition. for example- let’s suppose we have a table or huge data. And in our example figure we students marks and we want to see how many students got less than 50%.**Step 1**Select the cell range.&amp;#x200B;https://i.redd.it/1d9z8pee8gd41.gif**Step 2**Select the conditional formatting&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/yvzci2wk8gd41.png?width=1526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b561cf4ea1234fa626625f2883348036cf67ff3a**Step 3**Select the condition greater than or less than in our example we need less than.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/e7v6zagn8gd41.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5305a0e010937fda77eff3fa85279eaf5983f807**Step 4:** Put the values in the pop-up then click ok.Now the table is highlighting the marks below 50%.### 10. UPPER, LOWER, TRIM.These commands are useful when the user has huge data that is not well structured and well-formatted. All of these commands define its function. The lower feature has used to convert all the characters in small letters within a cell. The upper feature will convert all the characters in Capital letters within a cell. Trim will remove all the space within a cell.**Command keywords:** LOWER(cell\_number).UPPER(cell number).TRIM(cell number).  ### Conclusion.These are all the excel top 10 formula that everyone should know in order to boost excel skills. Each of these commands is very basic. If you want to start improving your excel skills, then you must concentrate on these basic excel top 10 formula. Each of these commands gets complex as you want to perform more complicated tasks on the excel. The importance will be more clear once you perform these formula by yourself then you will understand why we added them in the list for excel top 10 formula.`",`Excel Top 10 Formula For The MS Excel Beginners`

Because of the differences between Central Standard time and Zulu time, the Zulu time often works out to be on the following day.

Sheet 1 is a blank template that can be re-used daily, Sheet 2 is a duty schedule.Essentially, what I do is to ensure sheet 1 is to be updated daily with the statuses of personnel for that day, by making reference to sheet 2. For example, If I were to update Manager Charlie's status for the day on the nominal roll (sheet 1), on the 1st of January, I will make reference to sheet 2 and see that Manager Charlie's supposed status for that day is 'DUTY', in B7. I will then denote Manager Charlie's status on sheet 1 in D5 as 'DUTY' accordingly. At the moment I am doing this completely manually, by referencing sheet 2 and indicating accordingly on sheet 1, for all the personnel listed on sheet 1 (President to Junior). The example sheets I've included are truncated, so the actual sheets consist of a lot more personnel, which makes this very tedious.Currently, I've tried using VLOOKUP function to try and do matching, which I believe could only work if I were to edit the sheet 1 template to allow for the leftmost columns of sheet 1 and 2 to match, however I would prefer if there was an alternative way/function to going about my issue as I do not wish to alter the actual template that I use on a daily basis, unless absolutely necessary. Thus, I am asking to see if there is an alternative function I could use, or another way to utilise VLOOKUP in my scenario?I hope I have worded my question and elaborated fairly clearly.

I tried to research the sum function using other variables but have been unsuccessful in finding a solution. My issue is I have a spreadsheet where I am keeping track of items I need to order online, where I've ordered them, costs etc. On the next page to the right I have three sections for keeping running totals of Cost, Tax, Shipping Cost and Overall Total of the three. I have one section that is for everything on the sheet ordered or not ordered (that was easy to formula). The issue I am running into is I have a section for Ordered and Not Ordered where I would like to keep the same type of running totals. There is a field for each entry where it says ORDERED: and has either a Y or N as the value depending on whether I have ordered the item already. How to I create a formula that adds up the Cost, Shipping, Tax, and Total Cost but only if the ordered field is Y, or similarly N. So I can keep running totals based off of what has been ordered and what has not. I have included an image of the spreadsheet its probably easier to determine my question with it.

Now in order to dig into where i spent the money i have to go back into my source sheet and manually go line by line and look at the categories and see what i spend. This is a bit cumbersome as i have 100's of transactions a month, plus scanning like this doesn't yield the kind of insights i'd like.What i now want to do is create some kind of summary table where i can select the month or date range i want to check, and specify the category, and have it show me all transactions in the category, or by vendor etc.How do i do that? As i mentioned, i have all this data in google sheets. if someone know how to do it directly in sheets that would be awesome, otherwise if you tell me the excel solution i can then see if sheets has something similar.`",`Pulling transactions from sheet based on month and category`

Not exactly looking for a solution, but just thought I should ask in case anyone had encountered something similar.My current project requires me to identify possible products that may have taken another.e.g. SKU A might be taken over by SKU B due to a change in packaging size, but the total weight shipped should still follow the same trend as SKU A. so what I need to do is match SKU As to their respective SKU Bs, so that I can use the historical shipments of A to conduct forecasting. My current approach is largely to eyeball it.

As about 35 workbooks, literally thousands of links in each one. The kind of thing you really want a proper database or a BI suite for, but no one will pay for.The problem is that these links have a bit of a habit of changing when you open the files.For reference, the references are basically all:V:\Site A\Admin\Finance\...There are also a few links which read in the more traditional network way:\\SiteDrive\Site1\Site A\Admin\Finance\...(For clarity, SiteDrive is the physical disk in the server at head office, Site1 is the folder which we have mapped as V:)Either style of link works. The problem is that when you open some of the files, excel kind of hybridises the two reference styles, so I get:V:\Site1\Site A\Admin\FinanceSo it’s inserting the folder from the second style into the first. There isn’t a Site1 folder on the V drive, so obviously the formula don’t evaluate.I’ve never seen it do it before, it doesn’t do it in every workbooks (some it’s fine every time I open them), in the sheets that are affected, it doesn’t do it every time, and when it does, it doesn’t do it to every formula.As things stand, I’m just doing a find and replace to correct it when I open the file, but I’m handing this process off to someone who had never opened excel 6 months ago and hasn’t got the strongest computer skills in general, so I’d rather not leave him needing to edit network links in basically any file he opens.Anyone got any ideas about why it might be doing this or if these somewhere I can dig around to stop it happening?`",`Excel network links - network reference changing on its own`

What I want to do is have all the key information on just 1 row without having the Event ID being displayed on multiple rows.As shown in the attached screenshot, in column P, I have for removed the duplicates for each of the IDs and in cell Q2 I have used the formula **=VLOOKUP($P2,$A$2:$L$38,COLUMN(B1),FALSE)** and dragged across + down to populate/create an additional table which I will be working on. Based on the highlighted cell, only the Event ID which is being looked up within column P and the ""COLUMN"" lookup changes, e.g, **COLUMN(B1),** **COLUMN(C1),** **COLUMN(D1)**.This additional table appears to partially return what I am looking for. However, I need a formula to return the following on a single row for a specific Event ID:1. Based from the Date column (Column C) I want to return the **earliest** date shown of a specific ID within the additional table created on the right. For example Event ID 211680 has dates 01/10/2018, 02/10/2018 and 03/10/2018 across multiple rows. I just want 01/10/2018 to be returned as it's the earliest date. However, with my formula it is incorrectly returning the date 02/10/2018, as shown in my attached image (cell R5). What formula do I use to ensure it's looking for the **earlier date** for a specific Event ID?2. From the IR Code column (Column L) I want to return the IR code for a specific Event ID in terms of ""priority"" being shown in the following order: LOM, DAM2, DAM1, AOG, 41, 43. So for example, if in any of the rows for a specific Event ID, ""LOM"" does not appear, then it looks to return ""DAM2"", if that does not appear in any of the rows for a specific Event ID and DAM1 does, then ""DAM1"" is returned, as it's the highest priority code being shown. As shown with Event ID, it is returning the IR Code ""41"" (cell AA5), however, I want it to return ""AOG"" as it's the highest priority code. It appears my formula is only returning the values found within the first row of a specific Event ID. What can I do to ensure it returns the highest possible IR code?

This works fine with the current spreadsheet, but I have to manually adjust the graph range every time I enter a new date.

I figured out that if the date equals #N/A (when the share price column is empty) then you can select the whole date range and it will automatically populate the updates with the correct date.

When opening the file, progress was slow and Excel would hang on 100% for several minutes and would become unresponsive much of the time. After following all of the usual recommendations for file repair, Office reinstall, etc., etc., I searched various worksheets in the file and noticed that one must have had some sort of data in some ""far flung"" cell because the (sorry if this is the wrong terminology) ""slider box"" along the right side of the screen was very small and moved very slowly as one scrolled down the worksheet with the arrow keys. This in effect made the file size huge. Rather than find the offending cells, I simply copied the desired ones and pasted them into a new sheet, and then deleted the old sheet. BOOM, problem solved. File size dropped from 6,900 KB to 970KB and now loads, saves and generally operates properly.  To tell the complete truth, the situation was even worse at first — she had duplicated the problematic sheet, so the file size was over 12,000KB.

I am not sure if that is possibleWould work if can save and close the files after macro is applied.&amp;#x200B;This is the macro:    Sub LoopThroughFiles()        Dim xFd As FileDialog        Dim xFdItem As Variant        Dim xFileName As String        Set xFd = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFolderPicker)        If xFd.Show = -1 Then            xFdItem = xFd.SelectedItems(1) &amp; Application.PathSeparator            xFileName = Dir(xFdItem &amp; ""*.xls*"")            Do While xFileName &lt;&gt; """"                With Workbooks.Open(xFdItem &amp; xFileName)                      Columns(""A:A"").Select        With Selection.Validation            .Delete            .Add Type:=xlValidateInputOnly, AlertStyle:=xlValidAlertStop, Operator _            :=xlBetween            .IgnoreBlank = True            .InCellDropdown = True            .ShowInput = True            .ShowError = True        End With                End With                xFileName = Dir            Loop                    End If    End Sub`",`Is there a way to apply macro on multiple files and save and maybe close those automatically without or without opening excel?`

I've never dealt with this. Heres a quot from the API documents. &gt; With large result sets - e.g., query sets with more than 10 pages of results - we recommend you use the cursorMark parameter to walk through your results. You can use cursorMark to walk through the full product or store catalog, deltas since you last queried for active products, or any other query result. The cursorMark works a lot like a bookmark, keeping track of what subset of items are currently shown in your result set and how to get to the next subset of items.&gt; &gt; To use the cursorMark with your result set, add cursorMark=* to your query parameters. A nextCursorMark parameter will be included in the metadata that you will use to walk through the full result set. After the initial result, replace the asterisk * with the nextCursorMark value noted in the current metadata to move to the next subset of results. For each subset, a fresh hash value will be presented. To avoid errors, please urlencode the hash returned when sending it as the cursorMark query parameter in subsequent requests. When you reach the end of the cursor marks, you will receive an empty result.&gt; &gt; Tip: To query for updates or deltas since you last walked through the result set you can use the itemUpdateDate attribute. To ensure that your query results include changes to a product’s active/inactive status, add active=* to your query parameters. For example: .../v1/products(itemUpdateDate&gt;2017-02-06T16:00:00&amp;active=*)?format=json&amp;pageSize=100&amp;cursorMark=*&amp;apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY`",`power query cursor marks (REST API)`

Then I used the quick auto-fill to populate the column with the formula and CTRL + G → \[Special...\] to select all cells with Logical values, then CTRL + ""-"" → \[Delete entire row\] to get rid of all lines with (j).

Then I used the quick auto-fill to populate the column with the formula and CTRL + G → \[Special...\] to select all cells with Logical values, then CTRL + ""-"" → \[Delete entire row\] to get rid of all lines with (j).

So for example, a £3000 gross withdrawal gives you £2,758.33 after tax, so an effective tax rate of 10.74%, and if you make a withdrawal of £10,000 you get £7,624.98, so an effective tax rate of 31.67%The formula I have is that Gross Value = (4* Net Value) / (3* (1-Tax Rate)) + 1.Is there any way to do this in excel, whereby I can just enter the net value and it will calculate the gross value needed?

This is not really a problem, so I'm not really looking for ways to improve the time, unless it is really easy to implement.  I did find out some weird thing. At one time I wanted to stop the program prematurely because for some reason it was running slower than usual, and after pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete and opening the Task Manager, the program ran a lot faster. Knowing this, I decided to keep Task Manager open, but in my second try the program was still a bit slow. This time again, even though  Task Manager was still open, I pressed Ctrl+Alt+Delete and clicked Task Manager, and again my program instantly ran faster.  I think if I would understand why this is happening I might be able to implement this in my code and thus making this code run a lot faster. So does anyone know why this is happening? I checked this on more than one computer and it works on everyone so far. The effect seems to be more (or at least more noticeable) on the slower computers. Also, the reason I notice it so well is because my program contains a progress bar, so impatient clients don't prematurely close the program when Excel says it's not responding, even though it is still working on it's program`",`Why does my program run faster after pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete`

I've got 3500+ sites to complete (at current count, likely more), so ideally I would need a simple cyclical function to copy a value multiple times based on date.[This is the data that needs to be pasted daily.](https://imgur.com/a/XDdcrJl) Sometimes this data will be weekly, sometimes monthly, sometimes bi-weekly based on the dates of the recorded information. I am converting all values to daily values in another workbook manually (already using formula) and copy-pasting that into Sheet:""PasteArea"". Next, I would need Sheet:""PasteArea"" column B2-downwards until an empty cell is reached to be pasted to the next available free column on the other sheet in the workbook, Sheet:""InputSheet"".[Here's a screenshot of that workbook](https://imgur.com/a/hg2GaI3). I've had to redact information for GDPR, this is just identification information. All data would need to start pasting from row 7 downwards at the next available open column with no information. Identifier for if there is an available open column can be row 5, 6, or 7 (all should have information in them).Here is my thought process for how the macro should operate logically, it's just converting it to VBA/Macro (which I have minimal/little knowledge of).1. Data in Sheet:""PasteArea"" Cell B2 is copied.2. Determine where to paste in Sheet:""InputSheet"". If B7 has a value, check C7 for a value, check D7 so on until a column is empty. When a column is empty, start here.3. Date in Sheet:""PasteArea"" Cell A3 is compared to Sheet:""InputSheet"" Cell A7 (as the pasting needs to happen until the date is met in multiple formats, monthly won't work. If I use A3, It will paste until the date below is matched in daily).4. If Sheet:""PasteArea"" Cell A3 is younger than Sheet:""InputSheet"" A7, Paste the value in Sheet:""InputSheet"" at the cell determined by Step 2.5. Repeat the process until Sheet:""PasteArea"" Cell A3 is older or the same as Sheet:""InputSheet"" (Date in Column A).6. When the loop ends from Step 5 (When two dates match) then move to the next Cell in Sheet:""PasteArea"" (in this case Cell B3) and repeat the process.7. Repeat until all data in column B of Sheet:""PasteArea"" is pasted in the column determined by Step 2.Some useful information about the problem:* Input data will vary in size, but will always have a date attached to a value.* The data is calculated as daily values already. It just needs to be pasted multiple times. * I will always be pasting the data to Sheet:""PasteArea"" as I need to manually check the data beforehand for mistakes from export from a previous database.* As mentioned a few times dates change wildly based on input information but always move chronologically.I've made this long-winded but I wanted to provide as much information as possible to anyone that can help. It's essentially a copy-paste loop using a date condition, where the input data is variable so the parameter that can always be compared (the date) needs to be used for the process.I can provide any information as needed, I think it's a fairly simple process. I just have no idea how to go about it.Thanks for any help or information.`",`A macro to automate copy-pasting a value multiple times between sheets based on a date until next condition is met`

I'm an active duty USAF enlisted member.  My primary job is to manage deployments for a Wing.  This is largely done using a database that is essentially just a giant excel spreadsheet held on a classified system to give it a simple UI and user permissions.  They day-to-day work involves exporting portions of the database to compare for changes and declassify for distribution to various units.  The data has an extremely consistent format and usually uses various shorthand codes that are referenced against data tables to output the real info i.e. we might have a four-letter code that specifies a location, or and 8-character code to reference a unit.  That lets me use index/match formulas to simply data retrieval.What I'm looking to do is create a heatmap of the world showing how many people are deployed to a given location on the current day.  Normally, I'd use the built-in map chart function to do that, but our version of excel is hard coded to not allow it to link up with outside systems, so that function is disabled.  Macros, VBA, and any other type of programming is also locked out.  Anything I want to do has to be built from scratch using formulas, graphs, and pivot tables/charts.I've figured out how to automatically calculate how many people are deployed to each location on a given day, that was (relatively) easy.  The tricky part is plotting it onto a map to visually represent the data.  Commanders hate staring at numbers but love a good map.At this point, the way I've figured it out is to make a bubble chart based on the totals of each location, format the background of the plotted area to be a map of the world, have the bubbles sized based on the number of people deployed with a label stating the location name and number of deployed.The problem is, to designate the xy coordinates of each location, I have to play a guessing game by displaying a grid over the world and tweaking each location's coordinates one at a time.  It works fine, it's just a little time consuming to add a new location.  Once I have the location set up, I just reference the coordinates and I'm good, I'd just like to save more time and simplify it so it doesn't take someone as experienced as me to do it.Does anyone have a good way to translate GPS coordinates into xy coordinates on a given world map projection, or a better way of doing this without 3D Maps or macros?  I found a tool to convert GPS lat/long into a few different xyz map coordinates, but I'm not very knowledgeable on the different map projection types.  It'd be nice to just plug in the lat/long for each location and have excel runt the math to plot the location on the map.What I've got now is serviceable and accurate enough for what my bosses want to see.  It's just annoying because I KNOW there's a way to do it more accurately and set it up faster, I just lack the knowledge to pull it off.  If I can make something that's more plug-and-play, I can get it out to my whole career field and make all our lives better.`",`Looking for a better way to generate a global heatmap without using macros or external service access.

If you know WoW, great! if not, doesn't matter, I'll explain my variables.  So the first selection is '*faction*'. Once you select that, you choose '*race*' and then after that you choose '*class*'. All of these cells (except the first) used the INDIRECT function to read the preceding cell and call up a named range on my second sheet, finding the drop-down content. This has worked well, even with spaces in the string. For example, after selection of 'Alliance' as a faction, I need to call on 'Alliance\_Races' in my drop-down list data validation. So my formula is:`=INDIRECT(A3 &amp; ""_Races"")`So once a race is selected, things get tricky, because some of the strings have multiple spaces, so I can't use a simple trick. So for example, an easy one is if the race is '*Gnome*', as I can employ the same basic formula as above:`=INDIRECT(B3 &amp; ""_Classes"")`  Which gives the result '*Gnome\_Classes*'For a race such as '*Night Elf*', I have to use the formula below:`=INDIRECT(SUBSTITUTE(B4,"" "",""_"") &amp; ""_Classes"")`  Which gives me the desired '*Night\_Elf\_Classes*'.So, now we come to my roadblock: One of the races is '*Mag'har Orc*'.

Normally I’d knock this out with a standard pivot/VLOOKUP but the file became a beast before I even did the pivot. 180MB easy. Here’s the core of what I’m working with. Separated all this out into CSV as well. **Goal:** The goal is to track 12-week and 24-week nonbuy gaps on key items at key clients. We want to see if it’s a DC issue (supply) or sales issue (client). Shipment Data: External sales data. Invoice data per week, per sku, per client. About 450,000 lines. Each week, about 200 clients could potentially buy one of 150 skus. Each client ships from a unique Distribution Center, but client territory may span two DCs. Meaning they’ll have 2 unique shipments of the same sku during the same week (from separate DCs). The goal will be to update this monthly, with each month adding about 30k lines. DC Location: Several distribution centers across the country, divided into three regions. Need to slice by Region &amp; DC. Item List: This has our internal descriptions and will link to shipments by UPC. Item descriptions from the external file won’t work because they don’t match our own, so this is critical. This also flags our core items with an additional column.  DC &gt;&gt; Shipment is fine. That connection works. Item List &gt;&gt; Shipment Data, I get the duplicate error. Probably because of the multiple DCs shipping same sku/week at select clients. Item list has duplicates removed and no blanks on the linked column. Any ideas?`",`Power Pivot “Duplicates” Error`

As part of my job, I've been trying to develop a macro to transfer data automatically from one workbook I extract from SAP to a main workbook - that gets updated on a daily basis with data from the workbook extracted from SAP.  Three days ago, this community helped me out immensely and I now have a macro that transfers the columns I need from the SAP workbook directly to the first empty row of the main workbook. I'd like to add a couple of things to this macro though, and it's been a real struggle. &amp;#x200B;* Column A numbers the rows, starting from A2, down to the last row. Every time I transfer new rows to the main workbook, I have to drag this column down. Is there a way to add to my macro and make it so that every time I transfer data from the SAP workbook to the main one, this gets filled out automatically? &amp;#x200B;* Column B lists the date that the rows have been inserted in the main workbook. I usually click CTRL + SHIFT + ; and drag the column down again. As you can imagine, I'd like to include this in my macro so this gets done automatically as well.  And then there's the part that has been keeping me up at night. In the main workbook there are a few columns that contain formulas. These formulas will mark an ""X"" depending on the values of another column that gets transferred from the SAP workbook. I've tried to make it so that it searches the first cell containing data starting from the bottom of the sheet and automatically fills it down to the last row - but experienced little success and a massive headache in the process. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/x7ruykrpkl741.png?width=1379&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a85c8f0474c43915beccb90f0e7e3e9de759d687 I hope it's easier to understand what I'm talking about with this picture.

Column O is an example of one of the formulas I have to take into account. &amp;#x200B; P.S - Unsure what the difficulty level is when it comes to what I'm asking for here, I've started my Excel journey a little over a month ago and I feel like I still have much to learn.

If the previous debt is unpaid, just use the minimum payment for this debt.  &gt;Also, if the transaction date is on the date that the emergency fund was finished, use the leftover from the date the emergency fund was funded; **and** then the minimum predefined savings amount after that. I have been attempting to use IF functions, but I get lost in the weeds of all the ""if this then that, but only if this is that and that is this or this"".

Every single forum and blog that discusses Excel will not fail to have some pages on the INDEX MATCH technique. However I'm wondering, how often does the need to use it actually arise. In what cases were Vlookup, Hlookup or simple Lookup  not sufficient?Personally, I can't recall a time when I had to use INDEX MATCH. Thinking about it, it is probably because I have always ensured that all the tables I have made do not allow duplicated rows. Furthermore, the identifier for a row is always in the left most column. This seems natural as the primary in any database table is almost always the leftmost column. It only makes sense to do a lookup against a list of values that are all distinct and unique. Otherwise, if the value are not unique, it is no longer a lookup. It is more of a Table JOIN. There is additional logic required for such an operation. For examples: Merge the first, first N or all matches? Return the matches as a list, array or string? This is not something that can be done trivially either. Thus, it appears that for a vertical lookup, it is usually going to be a lookup against values in the first column, and then returning values some other columns to the right.`",`How often do you use INDEX MATCH ?`

I was hired on to help a company (that buys and sells items that stores originally couldn't sell/items that were returned) out that is months behind with their invoices and purchase orders and part of my job is to use Excel to compare Purchase orders that are already on a spreadsheet (Item name, quantity, price, total value of each item purchased) and then enter the same info of what is on the invoice.I have basic excel skills of basic formulas from what I'm learning in my accounting classes that I'm taking but I haven't done anything this big (I'm basically used to paying bills and data entry). My goal with this task is to basically see what what we really should be paying vs what we were charged.My set up that I have so far is the four columns of the item name/number, quantity, price, and total price (quantity X price), a green column to seperate that data, three columns for the invoice's item quantity, price, and total price, another green column to separate the data, and then two columns that dictate the difference between P.O. quantity and Invoice quantity (like =B2-F2), and then the total price difference.My supervisor is very busy/overloaded with work and doesn't have a lot of time to explain things to me, nor is he the best at communicating what he wants. He sent me a spreadsheet that he used a while back for a previous job he had with his own formulas that also have columns like favorable quantity value, favorable pricing, and unfavorable columns too that I don't seem to understand the concept of (I'm not that far in my accounting classes yet, but I have seen the words ""favorable, unfavorable"" being tossed around in my managerial accounting class with manufacturing accounting). I have shown him what I've done but he wasn't pleased.I apologize if this type of post isn't allowed and for my ignorance in Excel. I've been given a job assignment that I believe I'm under qualified for and I'm trying to use this situation as a learning experience instead of panicking about losing my job. I've done some googling and YouTube searching and haven't found anything to what I'm looking for/have done so far. Does anyone have any suggestions on templates or formulas I should use? Any and all help is gratefully appreciated. Thank you.Edit: I forgot to include some examples of some troublesome entries I've been having as well. These will probably be mundane to you experts. Each stack of papers I'm given is composed of 6 stores that roughly have the same P.O.s and invoices (just with the occasional small differences in item quantities and some item differences, but for the most part they're all the same) and each store gets their own sheet. There are items that are on the P.O. and not on the invoice and vice versa. The invoice has a set of 4 items (that are counted as one) that are discounted at $17.50 but the P.O. has them all individually labeled as each item that all together adds up to $17.50. There are 3 sets of those types but one of them on the P.O. add up to $17.68. There are items that either aren't on the P.O. or invoice but there will be a different item name and number that sort of has a similar name and the exact price. I can't know for certain but it sort of seems like whomever is creating the invoices and P.O.s are being rushed and are not given enough time to do quality work (or at least that's the rumor I heard on my first day).Edit 2: [Here is a screen shot](https://imgur.com/TjYgnGY) of a very, VERY simplified version of what I know how to do. I get the P.O.s from a database that exports everything onto a spreadsheet with all 6 stores' information on one sheet. I then copy everything onto another sheet and then hide the other 5 stores' columns and work on one store for one sheet. Everything before the first green column is given to me, I then manually add everything to the right for the Invoice columns and the differences columns. Annoyingly, I can't simply use the template he gave me for the favorable and unfavorable stuff because those invoices are set up differently for a different situation that I'm unfamiliar with; as well as, some of the columns he gave me didn't even have the formulas and I feel even more lost (which is partly on me for being inexperienced and ignorant in accounting).

I've been struggling when it comes to creating a simple macro and it's literally driving me nuts.

Seeing that this is a daily task and the data on EXPORT is always different, the idea would be to record a macro that would allow me to automatically transfer the data to **the last empty row of MAIN.**  It has proven to be quite the task so far, the macros I've recorded transfer the data over columns/rows that already have data.  Would appreciate some pointers if anyone else is having a slow post Christmas week.

I'm quite surprised that their team hasn't been able to build something for however many thousands of dollars they pay a year for an IT Team to do anything....? Although I've seen some of the programs they've launched and they don't function well at all...I took the initiative and spoke with our western territory manager and approached him with my set of skills as a excel programmer and told him I could solve their issue and have something that works for their needs. So he gave me all the appropriate info to build it for financing options etc. I did this on my own time not on work hours keep in mind. I built a functional program for him to see that it works in just ONE of the territories in the west so they couldn't take it and poof I'm out of any kind of compensation. He knows I've built this on my own time under my own business and tells me we can negotiate a price for the final program. Long story short, he was highly impressed. He showed all of his peers and VP's above him. Now the company I work for and our umbrella company wants a fully functioning program for all territories. Here's my dilemma.... I've only ever built and sold excel programs for small to medium businesses. Never a corporation. What and how would you suggest that I price this out?

The context to this is that this is for a director of repairs at a company. I'm trying to help him by developing a spreadsheet that justifies his request for a raise. This person isn't very good with computers so I offered to try to create a spreadsheet to help justify their case. I'm looking for more advice to see how else this information can be justified. He took over the director of repairs position in 2014. He received one raise in 2014 that was almost a 10% increase (for the position change), and another raise in 2017 that was just under 3%. The owner justified the lack of salary increases by providing bonuses at the end of the year if the target revenue is met, which have been as low as just under 1% and as high as 2.5% (to the base salary, which did not change a lot). When this person negotiated the two raises, the owner pretty much took away from the money earned as bonuses and added them into the salary. The first year this person took over the position in 2014, revenue increased 30%, and has increased 5%, 7%, 1%, and 9% every year since. In total, revenue has increased 50% since taking over in 2014. However, the owner of the company creates a budget which is essentially a productivity goal or target revenue. Since 2014, the ""budget"" has increased 29%, 0%, 3%, 9%, and 0%. In total, the target has increased 42% since 2014.  The bonuses that are received by this person are dependent on by how much the department revenue exceeds the budget. So the budget continues to rise (42% in 5 years), and the revenue continues to rise (50% in 5 years), eventually the bonuses will slow down because the revenue increase will naturally begin to slow down at some point. The important point here is that the department revenue has increased 50% in 5 years. I have a spreadsheet for all of this data. * The columns on the revenue page are: YEAR, BUDGET, BUDGET INCREASE, BUDGET PERCENT INCREASE, REPAIR DEPARTMENT REVENUE, REVENUE INCREASE, and REVENUE PERCENT INCREASE. I only have one graph which is just a line graph with one line, showing the 50% increase in revenue over 5 years. * The columns on the salary page are: YEAR, SALARY, SALARY INCREASE, SALARY PERCENT INCREASE, and ANNUAL INFLATION RATE. This page does not reflect any of the bonuses, and we don't think it should because it does not reflect a stable income. I think this page really drives the information home, it shows only two raises. One of them is related directly to the promotion, the only other raise was in 2017 that was just less than 3%. I have one question regarding the salary page: is it appropriate to show the annual inflation rate? The USD has inflated almost 10% since 2014, and this person has received 13% in raises and 10% of that was related to a promotion. Any recommendations in terms of how to depict some of this in graphs, or any other data I can try to manipulate to prove the point? This would really make an awesome Christmas gift for this person. Thanks in advance!`",`Looking for the best way to depict revenue vs salary to justify a promotion.`

Basically I am trying to summarize what amounts correspond to names for some of those text values, based on year. So each name has an amount corresponding to a given text value for a given year in one row, and then (in other rows) the same name appears with other amounts and different text values for different years. I want to show how the amounts in subsequent years relate to earlier years by ""Name"" as a function of certain of the text values. I can't share the data, but it's a report on grant funding. For individuals who had one type of grant in some year, how much money did they get from other grants in later years? It should be offset by at least 1 if not 2 years; it doesn't really help to just see the amounts for given years, which is what the PivotTable summarizes. Can a PivotTable be configured to show what I am trying to see or is there a different way to analyze the data? Open to recommendations for tutorial videos etc. Thanks!

ecuhzo,1024,12/20/2019,Discussion,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/ecuhzo/creating_a_dynamic_autoupdating_drop_down_list/,"`#Goal Create a drop down list that will automatically update when new entries are added to the list range and that will not break if the table name changes. This is useful because generally you want to maintain your data validation in an easier to track location, and will likely want to drive lookups from those values, so it's natural for the source data to be in a table.#IntroductionOne of my favorite things to do with Excel is take something that some folks would naturally turn to VBA for and figure out how to get it to work without a macro. Maintaining lists and data validation can be a serious pain, and in the past it's something I would've relied on VBA to do because it's ""easier"" (that is, I didn't want to figure out how to do it in Excel). The truth is it is pretty simple to implement something like this in Excel without VBA, though it's not exactly intuitive.#Details**UPDATE**: check out /u/gone_gaming's comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/ecuhzo/creating_a_dynamic_autoupdating_drop_down_list/fbdrmmq/) for an even simpler way to implement this! I replied to his comment with some screenshots as well :)[I will be using this screenshot for reference.](https://imgur.com/a/tdXjc1L) The blue table has my list (source for data validation and my match function) and my values (return for the index function). The orange table is just the implementation of the data validation and match/index function. The black table is what you need to get the data validation working, which is what I'm going to focus on here. All of the grey cells in the screenshot are just showing the formula text for the cells above them.1. Determine what you're source for data validation will be. In this case I'm using the List column of MyTable2. Enter the reference that you would ideally put in the Data Validation source in the InputFormula cell. You can't add table references to data validation, so what we're doing is a workaround to that limitation3. Get the formula text for the formula we created in step 2 and store that in the InputText field. This needs to be two separate cells because the FORMULATEXT function will only accept a cell reference as input4. Trim off the equal sign of the value returned in the InputText cell in the InputValidation cell. You could combine these two formulas into one cell if you want to--I've kept them separate to make it easier to follow in this demo5. Add Data Validation to the input cell, using an INDIRECT formula on the value in the InputValidation cell to get the reference to the List column of MyTableThat leaves us with a drop down that is safely tied to MyTable[List]! Now if I add another value to the bottom of that table, the table functionality will auto-add it to the table and it will be included in the dropdown. If I were to rename the table that would not break my data validation either.#Anticipated Questions**Q:** Why not put the table reference in the data validation ""Source"" field?  **A:** That field does not support table references, though ti does accept named ranges...**Q:** ...so why not just used a named range?  **A:** The reason we want to use a table here is because when you add more entries to the table it will automatically re-size, where as for a named range you'd need to update the reference. Tables have lots of benefits in general--for one, it ensures that the size of the result vector is the same as the input vector (assuming you keep them in the same table). If I were using formulas it would make sure those apply to all rows automatically**Q:** Why not just use the whole column as the source for the data validation? Then you wouldn't need to worry about re-sizing it if the number of options changes  **A:** If you use the whole column, it will show blank values in the dropdown for *every* cell in the column. This also might not be feasible depending on the structure of the workbook (i.e. if you're using cells below the table)**Q:** Why not just put the text for the table reference directly in the INDIRECT function call within the Data Validation Source field instead of going through all the trouble of forming it in the InputValidation cell?  **A:** You could certainly do this, but then your formula will break if the table name ever changes. What we've done here helps future proof your formulas.`","`Creating a dynamic, auto-updating drop down list without VBA`"

This was the first VBA I've ever wrote and it was MUCH easier then I thought it would be.First I watched the 4 videos for beginners.

For the portion I needed to pull in dynamic info I kept in HTML. I had a unordered list I inserted in the String section. The issue I ran into was too many continuations in HTML and I was getting tired. I found it easier to enter a string then to figure out how to add a second HTML section. These are my 2am thoughts, this seems non logical now. The ul actually formatted great on the email though and I'm not mad about it.I used the following to pull in the dynamic info into the subject &amp; body of the email.`.Subject = Cells(cell.Row, ""D"").Value &amp; "" Events - "" &amp; Cells(cell.Row, ""C"").Value``.HTMLBody = ""Hello "" &amp; Cells(cell.Row, ""A"").Value &amp; strbody`By this time it was almost 3am and I had to pull myself away. I still wasn't happy as I wanted my default signature to display in the email. This morning I found [this \[insert outlook signature\]](https://www.rondebruin.nl/win/s1/outlook/signature.htm) and was able to piece together with my previous written code. It works amazing!!

See screenshot here https://imgur.com/xoPt6MyFrequently, I might need to change my view to a different time zone, such as from EST to CST. I want to make this convenient by using a slicer. My challenge is that my data comes in EST by default, and I haven't found an easy way to quickly toggle that on a pivot table unless there's a separate row for each one. If this is true, this means I have to create an extra 3 rows (if I want CST,MT and PST) for each row I have. I'm wondering what the most efficient way to do this in Power Query would be. To start with, I know I could create 4 separate queries, use a formula to convert the time zone for each one, and then append them all into the same table.

I know basic Power Query but I'm no expert, and I'm not sure if there's a more magical way to output 4 rows with different timezones without me having to query the source data 4 times.

Interestingly in her journey Bhav has been privy to user data for online learning patterns and she gives great insights on to set yourself up for success when learning online!**Deb Ashby** – Deb has built a very envious career as a training consultant, where she works for the clients she wants to work with, from the comfort of her house at her own schedule! Deb has attributed this to lots of luck. But when someone is continually lucky, then it’s time to understand how this luck came about and I promise you won’t want to miss this great story of someone who plays by her own rules and has come out on top!**Chris James** – Chris had a long career working for top companies as a trainer before embarking on his own training ‘We Are Excel’ which has become one of London’s top Excel Training companies. With his infinite energy levels and amazing story telling ability, Chris enthralled me in explaining how he created a successful company, what he is doing differently that others. This is a must for any entrepreneur with a passion for teaching Excel.**John Michaloudis** – John is one of the most fun people in the Excel community, but when it comes to helping others improve their Excel skills, he’s very serious. His MyExcelOnline academy is currently training thousands of people to get better at all aspects of Excel. John’s story is amazing and truly inspirational, and he has developed a great mindset and envious lifestyle through nothing but grit, determination and sheer will.

When we are using Chrome (Most of the time) the borders we setup in excel to make the data look good do not paste into the browser.  Instead it shows the gridlines (Which we have disabled already) and the formatting looks bad.  In IE this isn't a problem but we cannot use IE sometimes.  I have found a solution that if i copy/paste the data into a notepad, and then copy from the notepad into chrome, it looks fine. Is there a way I can copy the data within an Excel VBA that will essentially do the same thing, or is that my only option?&amp;#x200B;Thanks`",`Is there a better way to accomplish this than copy/paste to notepad and then copy the data from Notepad?`

Trying to figure out how to identify what the most productive hour is in any given day or week or month, etc.  I can round the sectioned time in column D to the nearest 1:00, but it'll separate the 4:00 hr from the 5:00 hr rather than lump all of that together into one hour.I want to know that the productivity in one hour (from 4:37 to 5:21) was 32 sectioned/hour vs 19 in 4:00 and 13 in 5:00.  The latter doesn't reflect true productivity.Is this something that can be accomplished with formulas and/or pivot tables?&amp;#x200B;Sorry, it's not letting me add a screenshot.

For instance, say there is a payout structure that changes in $5,000 increments. At $30,000, the payout is equal to 20% and at $35,000 the payout is equal to 15%. In between these two values, the payout % scales down at a continuous incremental rate between 20% and 15% so that each additional incremental amount ($, cent, etc) between these two milestones had a different payout % associated. For instance, the incremental dollar at $30,001 has a payout that is slightly higher than the next dollar at $30,002, and so on. I want to be able to specify a point between these two milestones and rates (for instance, $32,000) and calculate the total payout $ amount based on this sliding scale.Any thoughts would be appreciated!

However, I am now running around in circles (PUN INTENDED) trying to figure out how to add a further iteration to the circular reference to have excess cash pay down debt, which recalculates interest and in turn increases the amount of cash, as I quickly realized that Excel does not really like this type of thing so much in terms of presenting consistent results without manual massaging.I have found several sources of info while looking for a better option, ~~including a~~ [~~VBA route~~](https://jkp-ads.com/Articles/circularreferences03.asp) ~~(does not seem appropriate for my use case unless I want to create hundreds of ""Iter###"" / etc records),~~ [~~Goal Seek~~](https://powerspreadsheets.com/excel-goal-seek-vba/) ~~(one cell at a time, but perhaps able to be scripted via VBA?),~~ and [an article](https://simplexct.com/avoid-circularity-in-financial-models) that suggests leaving circular references out of financial models entirely (?!).  As of this point, I am waving the white flag and coming to the Excel and VBA masters on this sub for further direction.I am very much open to learning a better approach.

The catch is that this is really to fill out a PDF form (which cannot be retyped in excel) so the trick I was using is:1. Prepare data table in Excel.

Open Word, set margins of 8.5x11 page (letter) to 0,0,0,0 (no whitespace boundaries since this is already included in the PNG images extracted from the PDF).4. Insert textboxes (arranged in front of text) and insert the linked data fields there.All works well. The PNG files can be dragged right out of the explorer window into the Word file, filling each page completely with no shrinking, enlarging, overflow, or remaining page space (since the digital template is EXACTLY 8.5x11). Being in front of the text, the textboxes cause no displacement and I can move them around freely.It's all quite nice, but it's a bit clunky. First if you move the files anywhere, the links break. Second I sometimes have long entries and have to mess around with the data field link types (must be linked via DDE) to avoid truncated data transfers.I would like to find a way to just paste that image of the PDF right into an excel sheet in my excel file so that everything is neatly in one file and then insert. Some problems I am having:1. The images get stretched, shrunk, spill over (it's a 5-page document that must be printed for EACH person/entry), distorted, etc... This cannot happen because the forms are format-sensitive (get fed into a machine that looks for entries in precise spots on the page).2.

Is anyone able to point me in the right direction of how to set up this problem?  Thank you!Alliance Air is a service in which customers pay a flat-rate to Alliance Air and are guaranteed a seat on an airplane between any two locations. To offer this service, Alliance Air prepurchases daily seats between every pair of major cities. A route which has been growing in popularity is between Phoenix and Dallas and Alliance Air is seeking your advice on how many seats to prepurchase between these two cities so that they maximize their daily profit.Whenever an Alliance Air customer flies on a prepurchased seat, Alliance Air obtains $100 in profits. However, if Alliance Air has more customers seeking a seat then they have prepurchased, Alliance Air is forced to book that passenger on a seat purchased that day. In such a situation, Alliance Air has a profit of -$170 due to the high cost of same-day flights. If not all of their prepurchased seats are taken, then Alliance Air makes a profit of -$20 by selling the seats at a discount to passengers outside of their customer base. Based on their data, Alliance Air knows that number of customers seeking a flight on any day follows a Poisson distribution with mean 40.Using this information, complete the following tasks/questions:1. Develop an Excel spreadsheet model which can calculate the daily profits for Alliance Air, assuming any particular demand for that day and that Alliance Air pre-purchased 37 seats on the plane.2. Using the given demand distribution, set-up your spreadsheet as a simulation model using daily profits as the output. Run the simulation assuming Alliance Air pre-purchased 37 seats on the plane. **What is the average daily profit in this scenario?**3. **How many seats would you recommend Alliance Air to prepurchase if they wanted to maximize their average daily profit?** To answer this, modify the number of Pre-Purchased Daily Seats from 30 to 55 (in the increments of 5) and fill in the table provided with statistics about the expected daily profits (Note that the average might keep changing slightly as you record those values, that’s ok). **What are the minimum and maximum daily profits if they were to purchase this quantity?

One more question - My client has a spreadsheet that makes a number of queries from other different spreadsheets (located on a Sharepoint). He recalls having all of those queries run in parallel for a total spreadsheet refresh time of about thirty seconds or so. Now, after some updates and fixes we've tried for some other Excel issues he's been facing, he's now finding that queries run one after another, giving him a much longer Excel refresh time. He uses vanilla Excel O365 and also Power Pivot add-in. He had been using Power BI as a trial, but for some reason doesn't use it much.I found the following solution for Power BI, but it wasn't applicable to generic Excel: [https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/Power-BI-Desktop-automatic-refresh-queries-one-by-one/td-p/155889](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/Power-BI-Desktop-automatic-refresh-queries-one-by-one/td-p/155889) I found the following forum thread from Microsoft indicating that Excel runs queries only sequentially: [https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/136cb2f6-af1a-4a6c-a16f-9de608dde961/refreshing-excel-connections-in-parallel?forum=exceldev](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/136cb2f6-af1a-4a6c-a16f-9de608dde961/refreshing-excel-connections-in-parallel?forum=exceldev) I did some Googling and the forum I read indicated that vanilla Excel can only run queries sequentially. \- Is this true? \- If so, is there some other add-in that would have given him this ability? \-Is it possible he's not remembering things correctly? \- Is there a way to run multiple queries in parallel that I'm not seeing?Once again, thanks everyone for your input.

Ideally, each student could be assigned their nr. 1 ranked subject. However, this is not possible because a maximum of 20 students can be assigned to each subject.Ideally, I could express this as a linear optimization problem, that the built-in Excel solver can solve.My best attempt at this, can be downloaded here:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ed4WJRZ4z5-jyxxWORSBiQppzNKRELtv/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ed4WJRZ4z5-jyxxWORSBiQppzNKRELtv/view?usp=sharing)&amp;#x200B;What I've basically done is apply a HLOOKUP function for each student, to identify what the ""rank"" is of the assigned subject, in the student's respective ranking. E.g. subject nr. ""5"" could have rank ""2"" for a student.I sum all the 'ranks of subjects' of all 200 students, and tell the solver to minimize this sum.Subsequently, I set the Excel solver method to 'Evolutionary' (basically brute-forcing by trying out many possible combinations of assigned subjects for each of the 200 students). This is necessary because the HLOOKUP function makes it impossible to use a traditional linear solver (because the problem is no longer a linear mathimatical problem, but instead one with embedded Excel formula's, i.e. HLOOKUP).I notice that, when I actually enforce the 'maximum number of students per subject' to 20, solving becomes extremely slow. Only if I set the maximum number of students per group to e.g. 100 (which is not what I want), solving is relatively fast and Excel finds a reasonable well-fitting combination of students being assigned to certain subjects.&amp;#x200B;If anyone knows a way to avoid HLOOKUP and turn this into a fast-solving linear optimization problem, I am all ears!&amp;#x200B;Best,Sam&amp;#x200B;EDIT: I seem to have solved my problem by experimenting with dummy variables, which allow me to avoid HLOOKUP formulas and turn it into an actual mathematical optimization problem, which can be solved quite easily.New version: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MqyH0VS2NaBpJfih7oZdHF3KaWxPU8fn/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MqyH0VS2NaBpJfih7oZdHF3KaWxPU8fn/view?usp=sharing)`",`How to assign 200 students to 10 subjects using Excel solver`

Using a series of drop down menus and user forms I can build a basic front elevation of what my product will look like whilst also deriving a list of sub assembly names that will make up the product. This sub assembly list can be viewed on a hidden worksheet. There could be over 200 of these required to make up the product.(e.g. My product could be made up of up to 16 Sections. Each Section could have 15 different sub assemblies. So my full product could have a combination of \~240 different sub assemblies, depending on the specific requirements.)I have named cells on the sub assembly worksheet where the sub assembly is stored. This sub assembly name is dynamic depending on selections in the configurator.(e.g. Cell name - ARE\_Section01 Dynamic sub assembly name in cell - AU\_ARE\_36\_36\_GA11\_AL3\_X\_13\_3\_\_ANSI\_61\_ or AU\_ARE\_22\_36\_GA11\_GA11\_R\_13\_3\_\_ANSI\_61\_ or AU\_ARE\_22\_36\_GA11\_GA11\_X\_13\_3\_\_ANSI\_61\_ or etc.)In order to build a top level bill of materials I am pulling information from an SQL Server where there is a table for every possible sub assembly (over 700 of them). Using PowerQuery, I have a query for each of the 15 sub assemblies mentioned above for each of the 16 sections. In these queries I am using a parameter that looks at the relevant named cell value rather than a hard coded value. This means I will only have 240 queries rather than 700+.(e.g. let Source = Sql.Database(""x\_BJMCC\\SQLEXPRESS"", ""AMX""), dbo\_AU\_ARE\_22\_36\_GA11\_GA11\_R\_13\_3\_\_ANSI\_61\_ = Source{\[Schema=""dbo"",Item=**GetValue(""ARE\_Section01"")**\]}\[Data\] in dbo\_AU\_ARE\_22\_36\_GA11\_GA11\_R\_13\_3\_\_ANSI\_61\_ )I then have a query for each of the 16 Sections which appends all the relevant sub assemblies. I then have a top level Panel query that appends all Section queries.I hope I have explained this properly so far.....My problem is this...When I hard code the assembly names into the queries the information gets pulled very quickly from SQL.

(Sadly educating them on the simple fixing it themselves isn't an option)Anyway I've done some googling as my VBA knowledge on formatting is basic and I never really looked into conditional formatting through VBA and was never taught it  sadly I couldn't find anything that could help, I found something that worked for inserting rows but not deleting.

The model has 2 main data tables, 3 categorization / Identifier tables, and one rule table (I'll explain).  The first main table is an export of a custom report out of SAP that provides cleared line item level detail by company code.  It's a fairly simple table consisting of around 12 headers and each line is a transaction.  In total there are less than 5,000 lines.  The second data table is a manual entry table for wire payments to related parties.  These are mainly debt payments so the transaction does not have an invoice being cleared which is why it's not in the main report.  This can be exported out of a different SAP instance that houses these instruments.  The categorization tables are lookup tables to provide the Vendor Name (vlookup), GL Account Name and Cost Center name (again, vlookups), they have additional information that I'm not pulling into the main data tables, but can be accessed via power pivot relationships that I've established (connected based on vender ID, gl account number, and cost number).  &amp;#x200B;The rule table has a custom function (UDF), that is fairly simple.  It loops through the rule list table to help categorize the transactions.  That way we can define rules in the table and the main data tables will be categorized based on these rules.  For example, we can match on an item's description (Drug A), the rule has a matching criteria of Drug A and if drug A is found in the item description then it will categorize the transaction as inventory.  We can also create a rule that matches on Vendor ID, GL Account, Cost Center etc.  If a rule is found, the category is assigned.  Here is my custom UDF.  It has several inputs from the main data tables and then loads the rule list matching criteria and category in an array.  It then loops through each rule and attempts to find a rule.&amp;#x200B;    Public Function FK_TaxCategories(LineText As String, CostCenter As String, _                                        GLAcct As String, Vendor As String, PO As String, RuleMatch As Range, RuleCat As Range)                                            Dim r    Dim rnum As Long    rnum = 1            For Each r In RuleMatch            If InStr(1, LineText, r, vbTextCompare) Then            FK_TaxCategories = RuleCat(rnum, 1)            Exit For        ElseIf CostCenter = r Then            FK_TaxCategories = RuleCat(rnum, 1)            Exit For        ElseIf GLAcct = r Then            FK_TaxCategories = RuleCat(rnum, 1)            Exit For        ElseIf Vendor = r Then            FK_TaxCategories = RuleCat(rnum, 1)            Exit For        ElseIf Left(PO, 2) = CStr(r) Then            FK_TaxCategories = RuleCat(rnum, 1)            Exit For                        End If                FK_TaxCategories = ""No Rule Assigned""                rnum = rnum + 1        Next r        End FunctionThe function seems fairly efficient in that it updates all records in about a second or so.

For instance:* There's a cap on certain expense items.* Some grants only allow a certain % of expenses to be deducted.* Sometimes expenses are to be charged against 2 or more grants and some expenses have various tax codes (e.g. A grocery receipt may have some items that are tax-exempt, some with GST and some with GST and PST. And that bill is to be divided between 3 different grants. That's 9 lines to enter).I currently just use VLOOKUP for the following:* If I enter the payee, the payee info is populated* If I enter the project/grant, the department ID, fund code and the manager in charge is populatedThere are other elements on the expense form that may need to be filled out (e.g. if an exception memo is required). Is it possible to highlight these areas in yellow or another colour so that I'm reminded that they may be required; but when I print the form, the highlighted area doesn't show up as coloured?Also, is there a way to create a saved file on my desktop automatically with this naming convention: **Reference/Invoice Number - Payee**.If you could also share other ways that can reduce clerical error or increase efficiency, I'd really appreciate it.

First, let me say this is a great community - it has been a lifesaver these past two weeks that I've spent trying to create this report. However, I've hit a sticking point that I cannot seem to get around. The issue:I work for a nonprofit organization that uses an online credit card processor to process donations. This processor generates two reports for us - one is a summary report of all donations within a timeframe, including the donor's name, address, phone number, donation amount, fund where they want the money to go, etc. The second report is a tribute report. Donors have the ability to give in honor or memory of someone, to leave a note , and to tell us where they want that acknowledgement sent (for example, if someone gave in memory of Mrs. Smith, who recently passed away, they could tell us to inform Mrs. Smith's daughter, which we will if they provide the contact information).The tribute report's information does not export on the donation report - all the donation report will tell us is if the donation was made in honor or memory of someone. Obviously, not everyone gives in honor or memory of someone. I, through an unfortunate set of circumstances, came to be in charge of printing this daily report for the people who write thank-you notes and record the information in our donor database and they want all the information on one page (before there was some convoluted method including printing emails ... it was a mess). My goal is to just dump the two exports into two different sheets and have a third sheet auto-pull all of the information to the correct field (unless there is an easier way I'm not aware of).I used INDEX MATCH to match the name of the donors on the donation report with their name on the tribute report, with the intent of pulling the tribute name, note, etc. All was fine and dandy until I had the same donor give multiple gifts in memory of different people, as the INDEX MATCH function was only pulling the first tribute name it came across. Is there a way to, once it pulls information from a certain cell or from a certain row, for it to go to the next name to pull?

I have an idea on how to attack this but frankly it feels crappy. **Scenario:** I have a path ( [https://imgur.com/a/BDT8feB](https://imgur.com/a/BDT8feB) ) where people can enter/exit the path at various points (A, B, C..). I know where each person enters and exits the path.  I also assume the person walks a straight line between the entry and exit points. **Goal:** I want to know how many people have walked in each segment between two points.  For instance, if Bob walks from A--&gt;D and Jill walks from B--&gt;C, I want to show that 1 person walked between A-B, 2 people walked between B-C, and 1 person walked between C-D.  I also want to tell which segments each person has walked through. **My thoughts so far:** Initially I thought this would be a good application of an ordered graph modeled with an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.  This still leaves me with 2 issues: **A)** it feels clunky, I don't know if it's the best way to approach this and **B)** once I have the path modeled in an adjacency list/matrix, I don't know how to apply the entry/exit information for each person to this matrix and extrapolate the goal I mentioned above.`",`Directed graphs and pathfinding in Excel`

This workplace is a 24hour station. We work 4 10s but there are no set schedules at this time because I'm looking at finding options that cover as many hours as possible with minimum overtime.

Columns 1-21 for our 21 workers repeated 7 times for each day of the week. I would go in, mark the hours a person worked on all 4 days with a 1 and sum it up.

All valid 4 day work days. The final thing I'm trying to set up is simply an hourly count by day of staffing.

Use a mixed reference to the cell in the Miscellaneous  Standards &amp; Filter range.**  =IF(H14=""Yes"",""Early Admission"",IF(I14=""Yes"",""Early Rejection"",IF(F14&gt;=2900,""Admit"",""Reject""))) is all I could come up with and it works but it's wrong.

Repeat for Cashier A, Transaction Type B, Type C, and Type D.I don't know if this is even possible, or if my better bet would be to just create a pivot filter and copy the totals that way. I just assumed there would be some sort of way to make it search for a specific cashier in the cashier column, and then pull from that specific row to look for a specific line item in the transaction column. If it didn't match, it would go to the next entry that had that cashier's name, and then would total the amount of times it found that specific cashier and those specific transactions.Am I asking too much from Excel?

It sums everything where the state is either Unpaid or Incomplete. The problem with that is, that in case the state is Incomplete it does not sum the difference between what is budgeted and actually paid already. This is what I am looking for. To determine the proper state (Unpaid, Incomplete, or Paid) I use a margin which is set at 10% in cell D6.Actual payments what are from 10% below the budgeted value and up is considered Paid. Any payment made that is below that threshold, and not an empty cell the sheet considers ""Incomplete"".Ideally, the amount still to pay in the example sheet should read: €210 but as you can see it reads €390 because of the error in calculation. Unfortunately, I do not know how to rewrite the formula in D8 to sum the difference when \[State\] is ""Incomplete"".Here come the formulas:Every cell in the \[State\] column:    =IF(ISBLANK([@Budget]),"""",IF(ISBLANK([@[Actual amount]]),""Unpaid"",ALS([@[Actual amount]]&gt;=([@Budget]-($D$6*[@Budget])),""Paid"",""Incomplete""))) The actual formula for D8:    =SUM(SUM.IF(Tabel1[State],{""Unpaid"",""Incomplete""},Tabel1[Budget])) I hope this gives a clear image of my issue, if not please let me know so I can add information that might be missing. :)Thanks a lot for any and all help you guys/girls/otherwise enclined can and want to provide! :DKA`",`How to conditionally sum partially or fully values in column depending on other cell's content`

I went to a few benchmark sites and attributed a score based on performance to each cpu and gpu, ram and storage are basically defined by more GB=better.This is mostly done.What I need is some help or guidance on how to maintain this Excel sheet and make it sustainable and more straightforward.Like a person inputs the product ID code, and fills in the specs which will (by vlookup, probably) get the respective spec score, and calculate automatically which segment it belongs to.I can foresee a few problems:Firstly, spec score is attributed as a relationship to the maximum score that spec category has.For example: gpu has 40% weight on the final score so the maximum score the spec will have is 40/100. If along the way some gpu is released into the market that is better than the rest already there, it will influence the other gpu's score. Because benchmark values will increase with the new gpu and the max score of gpu's is bigger hence other gpu's scores will be lower.How do I automate this process? How can I put the sheet so that it will be sustainable with only a few input updates?Secondly, how do I make it simpler and nicer visually?

It's just a small, service, doesn't matter why I chose Excel.So, I want to easily identify which client has made the payment in certain time limit. I made columns with their names, contact, etc, and a divided column that contains Dates, and those dates are: Date of providing service, Date by which the client has to make the payment (which is 5 days after providing service), Date of actual payment (once it's made), Date of service expiry and a special cell that contains the current date. So, I would like to make Excel automatically color the whole row for certain client, depending on the current state. There can be following states:1. The client has not yet made the payment, but the current date is also in those 5 days limit in which the customer has to pay. I'd prefer to color the whole cell row in a neutral, yellow color.2. The client has made the payment. I manually add in the date in the cell/column for Date of actual payment. Then, I would like to color the whole cell row in a green color.3. The client has not made the payment and the 5 day limit has expired. The cell row should be colored in red, and by that indication, I can shut down the service to the client and notify them.While writing this, I realised that the 2nd state might have a conflict with 3rd state, in which the client has payed, for example, in 2 days during the 5 day limit, but then after 4 days, the condition might switch to 3rd because the current date is greater than 5 day limit, compared to the Date of providing service. I hope you understood this part.So, I thought that I could do this with simple IF function, but I didn't know if it was possible to use it to also color the whole cell row. The Highlight function, as I understood when using it, only colors those cell in selected range, which have great, lower, equal or between value than certain selected value. Could I possibly be looking at it the wrong way?Can someone guide me through this? Or perhaps suggest me an actual software that can do this? I really don't need any other fancy features, that's also why I chose Excel, because I can just write whatever I want.Thanks!`",`How do I color cell rows depending on certain values (Not the highlight option)`

For this I have found two options, which are both lacking in different points.For one there is the legacy version of Excel's change tracking, in which you can ""List changes in a new sheet"". It works perfectly fine for me, my only problem is that I would need this history tab to always be open and not hide itself after saving changes done to the file, because having to reopen the history tab after every change seems a bit cumbersome to be presented in front of others. So the question I'm researching is *""Can the history tab be always shown?""*. I couldn't find an answer to this yet, so maybe someone knows better?  Something else I am curious about is whether I can extend this history tab by other data to my liking. I would like to add an additional column that includes a reference to the row in which something was changed, e.g. ""if cell A4 was changed, check C4 to copy the identifier of this case"". Would that be technically possible at all?The other solution I have been looking at is coding that history sheet myself using VBA. For this, I have found a handy template [here](https://www.exceltrainingvideos.com/track-changes-automatically-in-worksheet-with-vba/) which happens to work once I insert the code, but then for unknown reasons just stops functioning, meaning there are no further changes recorded (as if the code was inactive). My excel sheet works fine at that point, so maybe there is something wrong with the code. I would be very glad to get advice from you, since, for one, I would learn something new about Excel and, for two, I'd be more efficient at what I do thanks to the new features.Here's what I copied into my excel file:    Dim oldValue As String    Dim oldAddress As String    Private Sub Workbook_Open()        Private Sub Workbook_SheetBeforeDoubleClick(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As Range, Cancel As Boolean)    On Error Resume Next    If Sheets(“LogDetails”).Visible = xlSheetVisible Then    Sheets(“LogDetails”).Visible = xlSheetVeryHidden    Else    Sheets(“LogDetails”).Visible = xlSheetVisible    End If    Target.Offset(1, 1).Select    End Sub    Private Sub Workbook_SheetChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As Range)    Dim sSheetName As String    sSheetName = “Data”    If ActiveSheet.Name &lt;&gt; “LogDetails” Then    Application.EnableEvents = False    Sheets(“LogDetails”).Range(“A” &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0).Value = ActiveSheet.Name &amp; ” – ” &amp; Target.Address(0, 0)    Sheets(“LogDetails”).Range(“A” &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Offset(0, 1).Value = oldValue    Sheets(“LogDetails”).Range(“A” &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Offset(0, 2).Value = Target.Value    Sheets(“LogDetails”).Range(“A” &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Offset(0, 3).Value = Environ(“username”)    Sheets(“LogDetails”).Range(“A” &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Offset(0, 4).Value = Now    Sheets(“LogDetails”).Hyperlinks.Add Anchor:=Sheets(“LogDetails”).Range(“A” &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Offset(0, 5), Address:=””, SubAddress:=”‘” &amp; sSheetName &amp; “‘!” &amp; oldAddress, TextToDisplay:=oldAddress        Sheets(“LogDetails”).Columns(“A:D”).AutoFit    Application.EnableEvents = True    End If    End Sub        Private Sub Workbook_SheetSelectionChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As Range)    oldValue = Target.Value    oldAddress = Target.Address    End SubThank you for reading, I highly appreciate it!Regards`","`Extending the ""legacy"" tracking of changes within Excel vs. using VBA for a complete redo`"

In a restricted environment this isn't an ideal situation. I was frustrated that everywhere I looked said it wasn't possible to do this, so here is a way to get a multiple selection - e.g. apples, oranges, pears in one cell using Data Validation.First create a list of your selections in A1:A4 and give each cell a name in name manager. This isn't an essential step but makes managing the potential to tedious setup process easier. Don't enter the quote marks  in the cell - they're just there to indicate the space at the end.    Cell   Value            Name    A1     ""red; ""         red    A2     ""blue; ""     blue    A3     ""green; ""     green    A4     ""yellow; ""     yellowNow create a second list in cells B1:B4, or anywhere.

Check in-cell dropdown.Now, in cell E1, clicking the arrow gives you a selection from the four colors, select one. Now click the arrow again and you are presented with the remaining possible selections. Select and repeat.If you wish to be able to have multiple instances of the same color e.g. red; blue; red; then replace the values in B1:B4 with the final term in the IF statement - e.g. =E1&amp;red etc.`",`Here is how to have a multiselect dropdown without VBA`

Ctrl, +: inserts a new row or column. Ctrl, -: deletes a new row or column. Shift, space bar: highlights the whole row. Ctrl, space bar: highlights the whole column. Alt,E,S,F: copy and paste formulas so you won’t ruin any formatting. Alt,E,S,V: copy and pastes as values. (You can use a lot in side of Alt,E,S,......).
