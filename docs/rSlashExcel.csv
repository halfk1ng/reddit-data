(vendors, periods of time, dollar amount, etc.) without breaking down the rest of the math, i figured that before the final step (data that the pivot table is based on), i could branch a table out from all that data but only have the vendors/years/period columns, then manually add the dollar amount columns beside that connected table, insert the necessary data accordingly, then merge that result back into the power query chain for the pivot table to then use.that worked fine during the first time i did it. however, when i refreshed the data lately all the extra columns i added to the connected table disappeared. im not surprised by that (clearly the tab completely refreshes, now knowing) but am wondering what solution -does- exist.considering most of this data will be manually entered, i am -really- trying to use this hypothetical table as a tab in the workbook instead of connecting more external data and merging that way. one of the biggest reasons is to stay organized, plus avoids incompatible data due to mismatched vendor names &amp; numbers, etc.important too is that if there are new vendors created or new periods in the year as time goes on the aforementioned editable table would simply append the new lines without scrubbing out all the previous work. i need to figure out how to auto-sort the table after that, but right now i need the table to simply be stable first.i hope im explaining it clearly and can have a lead or three about how to pull this off. thanks.",can power query create an editable data table and cycle that back into its results?

ending zip codes, and realized in order to make sense of this, i need mileage between locations. i had basically three options:**1.)** get our it admin to approve purchasing api access to google maps, and elevate my permissions to allow for running python/js queries from within excel (our anti-malware software blocks this.)**2.)** manually enter each zip code into google maps, and type out the # of miles into each cell, which could take forever.**3.)** create a script that will navigate to google maps using internet explorer, search the html code for the # of miles, and paste that value into excel.i opted to go with option 3 since it was the quickest and cheapest option to get the information i needed. i wanted to share this script with the /r/excel community in case someone out there in the future needs to find distances without paying for a service, or doing 1 at a time.**notes**1.) youll need to create references to a few different libraries within your workbook:**microsoft forms 2.0 object library**,**microsoft internet controls** and **microsoft html object library**2.) this script essentially scrapes the html code from the google maps navigation page. if in the event google decides to update their source code, this could cause the macro to stop working properly.3.) you can use zip codes, addresses, cities, states, or coordinates as your input values.4.) because excel truncates numbers starting with 0, the macro is written to add a 0 to the start of any zip code with &lt; 5 digits (mostly in the state of nj)**how it works**1.) youll first highlight the cells you want to insert the miles into, then run this macro.2.) youll be given two prompts, first one is to select the column containing your starting location (you can select either the column or an individual cell, doesnt matter). then the same thing for your destination location.3.) excel will do its thing, and within 5-10 seconds, you should see the distance in miles populated in your highlighted cell.i have tested this macro and it seems to work 95% of the time. once in a while it will return nothing, but when ran again, returns the value im looking for. its not flawless, but it works.**main code:**    sub getdistance()    application.screenupdating = false    dim rng as range    dim cell as range    dim start_column as integer    dim end_column as integer    set rng = selection    dim htmldoc as htmldocument    dim ie as internetexplorer    dim ohtml_element as ihtmlelement    set ie = new internetexplorer    ie.silent = true    ie.visible = false    starting_zip start_column    ending_zip end_column    with activeworkbook.activesheet    for each cell in rng.cells    dim start_zip as string: start_zip = .cells(cell.row, start_column).value    if len(start_zip) &lt;

f0jhg3,2256,2/8/2020,solved,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/f0jhg3/are_there_any_ways_to_simplify_this_formula/,"let me provide an overview of what the formula does.  i have a workbook where i create a new sheet every week, and each week i carry over comments relating to the row.  there are two columns, one for previous comments and one for new comments.  the formula will check if there are any new comments and supersede any previous comments with those, and if not then it will carry over the previous comments.  if no data is found in new comments, and if any values are 0 from previous sheet formulas, blank is returned.  this is nested inside an iferror for the cases where there are any new entries that fail the lookup.  the new comments will be written text, while the previous comments will contain the formula. this enables me to type over any text in the new comments column so the comments are carried over the following week.i have a previous version of the formula which requires me to update the sheet reference the following week as this is easier to look at, as follows (column t being new comments, column u being previous comments):  =iferror(if(xlookup(a6,20200105!a:a,20200105!t:t)=0,if(xlookup(a6,20200105!a:a,20200105!u:u)=0,,xlookup(a6,20200105!a:a,20200105!u:u)),xlookup(a6,20200105!a:a,20200105!t:t)),)this works perfectly for my case but the reason i ask for a way to simplify this is due to a dynamic version that i have created.  this includes the use of a function defined sheetname that obtains the name of the active sheet.  this way, when i create a new sheet, all i need to do is rename it using a reverse date format (yyyymmdd, as per above formula) which also has the added benefit of dynamically obtaining and sorting the data i need for the date format i use to name my sheets.  (on a side note, this is all thanks to the dynamic array formulas!)the new version of the above formula is as follows (column x being new comments, column y being previous comments):=iferror(if(xlookup(indirect(&amp;sheetname(sum(sheet())) &amp;!&amp;cell(address,o6)),indirect(&amp;sheetname(sum(sheet())-1) &amp;!o:o),indirect(&amp;sheetname(sum(sheet())-1) &amp;!x:x))=0,if(xlookup(indirect(&amp;sheetname(sum(sheet())) &amp;!&amp;cell(address,o6)),indirect(&amp;sheetname(sum(sheet())-1) &amp;!o:o),indirect(&amp;sheetname(sum(sheet())-1) &amp;!y:y))=0,,xlookup(indirect(&amp;sheetname(sum(sheet())) &amp;!&amp;cell(address,o6)),indirect(&amp;sheetname(sum(sheet())-1) &amp;!o:o),indirect(&amp;sheetname(sum(sheet())-1) &amp;!y:y))),xlookup(indirect(&amp;sheetname(sum(sheet())) &amp;!&amp;cell(address,o6)),indirect(&amp;sheetname(sum(sheet())-1) &amp;!o:o),indirect(&amp;sheetname(sum(sheet())-1) &amp;!x:x))),)while this works, the formula is quite long and im wondering if there is a way to shorten this.  any ideas welcomed!",are there any ways to simplify this formula?

hlookupas the name of this command it allows users to lookup for a value in an array. in vlookup ‘v’ stands for vertical lookup. similarly, in hlookup h stands for horizontal. basically in these commands we lookup for the values in an array.**command keyword:-** vlookup(lookup value, table array, column index number, range lookup).and hlookup((lookup value, table array, row index number, range lookup ).so these are formulas that will provide you flexibility in the excel sheet. this command made it on the 4th position on our list of excel top 10 formula. ### 5. concatenatethis command is used to combine the characters of two different cells. this is applicable when we have to combine first name, last name and combining addresses from a huge datasheet.**{image, gif}****command keyword:** concatenate(text1, text2, text3…).### 6. max and minas the name suggests, the main function of both the commands is to search for the maximum value in a huge table, and the minimum value in a huge table.**{image,gif}****command keyword: ‘**max(select range)’ and ‘min(select range)’.### 7. andthis is one very useful function. the user can use this function to check if any condition is true or false. there could more than one condition.**{image,gif}****command keyword:** and(logic 1, logic 2,…).for example, and(a1=”good”,c3&gt;5) output would be true if a1 is good and the value of c3 is greater than 5.### 8. properthis command is useful when you have huge data which is oddly formatted. if a cell has “time is money” clearly the sentence needs formatting. so the user can use the proper command, for example, =proper(cell\_number) and it would output a well-formatted sentence in the cell.&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/f8px0a6b8gd41.jpg?width=631&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a64869780151d6b6267aff65a2449dc005e9d82c**command keyword:** proper(cell no1., cell no2…), or proper(cel no1: cell no10).### 9.conditional formattingthis command is useful if the user wants to format things with the condition. for example- let’s suppose we have a table or huge data. and in our example figure we students marks and we want to see how many students got less than 50%.**step 1**select the cell range.&amp;#x200b;https://i.redd.it/1d9z8pee8gd41.gif**step 2**select the conditional formatting&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/yvzci2wk8gd41.png?width=1526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b561cf4ea1234fa626625f2883348036cf67ff3a**step 3**select the condition greater than or less than in our example we need less than.&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/e7v6zagn8gd41.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5305a0e010937fda77eff3fa85279eaf5983f807**step 4:** put the values in the pop-up then click ok.now the table is highlighting the marks below 50%.### 10. upper, lower, trim.these commands are useful when the user has huge data that is not well structured and well-formatted. all of these commands define its function. the lower feature has used to convert all the characters in small letters within a cell. the upper feature will convert all the characters in capital letters within a cell. trim will remove all the space within a cell.**command keywords:** lower(cell\_number).upper(cell number).trim(cell number).  ### conclusion.these are all the excel top 10 formula that everyone should know in order to boost excel skills. each of these commands is very basic. if you want to start improving your excel skills, then you must concentrate on these basic excel top 10 formula. each of these commands gets complex as you want to perform more complicated tasks on the excel. the importance will be more clear once you perform these formula by yourself then you will understand why we added them in the list for excel top 10 formula.",excel top 10 formula for the ms excel beginners

(like if a cell on sheet1 is linked to sheet9 it would take you to that cell). f5: will take you back to the previous sheet you were on. f2: brings up the formula in that cell. ctrl, +: inserts a new row or column. ctrl, -: deletes a new row or column. shift, space bar: highlights the whole row. ctrl, space bar: highlights the whole column. alt,e,s,f: copy and paste formulas so you won’t ruin any formatting. alt,e,s,v: copy and pastes as values. (you can use a lot in side of alt,e,s,......). ctrl, 1: brings up the cell formatting screen. here you can “center across all selections” instead of merging cells. ctrl, any keyboard arrow: will take you in that direction until something changes.",basic keyboard shortcuts i’ve recently learned!
