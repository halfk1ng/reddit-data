In other words, if I copy the recipient list, it is copied to the clipboard in multiple formats. Depending on where I paste it, the most appropriate format will be used, so if I paste it to the recipient list of a new mail, it will be pasted exactly as is, but if I paste it to a container that supports that format (like this post, for instance), it will paste as text like this: &lt;code&gt;The Clown, Bozo &amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;bozo@theclowncompany.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;; The Clown, Bozo2 &amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;bozo2@theclowncompany.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can probably guess where this is going. The goal is to take this one-line list of text and turn it into a nice table like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Last Name&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;First Name&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;E-Mail&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The Clown&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Bozo&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:bozo@theclowncompany.com\"&gt;bozo@theclowncompany.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The Clown&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Bozo2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:bozo2@theclowncompany.com\"&gt;bozo2@theclowncompany.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how? Like this: &lt;a href=\"https://v.redd.it/nu4rlv8kla751/DASH_720?source=fallback\"&gt;click to see video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the video, you only create the query once. When the input changes, you can just refresh the results table to apply the transformation again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that if you&amp;#39;re using Office 2010 or 2013, you&amp;#39;ll need to &lt;a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=39379\"&gt;Download Microsoft Power Query for Excel from Official Microsoft Download Center&lt;/a&gt;.
