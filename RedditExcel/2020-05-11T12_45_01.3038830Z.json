Originally the process was :\n\n1. Make a plain text file with a table of input data\n2. Open the fortran program\n3. Type in the name of your plain text file\n4. Let the program run\n5. Open a new output file with the results of the calculation. \n\nCreating the input files and reading the output files using Excel and VBA is fairly straightforward, however I'm hoping someone here might have some advice they could share to improve the process of running the file itself. \n\nCurrently the macro works likes this:\n\n1. Shell Command to open the program\n2. Wait for a predetermined amount of time to allow the program to open\n3. SendKeys command to 'type' the name of the file\n4. Wait for the same predetermined amount of time, to allow the program to run and automatically close\n\nThis has works fine, more or less. However, until now, I've been running around 30-40 max input files but it would actually be useful now to start running up to 1000+ cases. Also, the \"predetermined time\" is not always enough, and has to be varied depending on whether you're working locally, on the business server or (obviously more relevant now) via VPN. \n\nIdeally, I would like to be able to open a single command prompt window and have the VBA recognise when the program is open and ready to accept the input of its name etc, but I've not been able to google up anything which seems to be able to help. Even if it was possible to pause the program until the shell closes would be useful.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated, even if it's just a suggestion of where it might be a good idea to post the question.","author_fullname":"t2_9w9mm","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"VBA Macro to run a program in command prompt","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Waiting on OP"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/excel","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"waitingonop","downs":0,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_ghllrz","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":0.6,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Waiting on OP","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1589224363.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.excel","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As part of my job, I&amp;#39;ve developed a spreadsheet which automates an ancient fortran program.

I’m in the cannabis field. I just got a job as a dispensary manager and inventory manager (2 roles one job). \n\nMy excel skills are basic. I worked with pivot tables but never created from scratch. I only understand sum and very basic excel functions. I can fill in and obviously understand and track data but I’ve never built a spreadsheet from scratch. I worked with ERP and SAP systems too but again I only worked on the outside. I was trained how to insert data but never to troubleshoot and learn the barebones. ERP and SAP is so valuable and I’m hitting myself for not learning more when i was at that job! \n\nI would like to take the MOS Excel expert exam to add to my job experience and resume. My job experience is very transferable. I am earning my psych degree and can transfer into multiple fields especially with certification +experience under my belt. I’m most interested in becoming an operations manager. \n\nAlso would adding a stats minor to my psych degree help? I already need two stats courses to graduate and I got a 93 in the first one. I don’t mind stats but I’m worried a minor will be a waste of time and money (going into 3rd year and my schedule is already stacked so I’d had enough to graduate later). \n\n2 questions:\n\n1. How long did it take to learn excel for you? \n\n2. How did it affect your career/salary ? (I’m currently at 50k but looking to be around 80k when I graduate in 2022 (is this a far fetched dream 😩🤣) Supply chain does pay well higher up and the cannabis field is growing in Canada by the minute. \n\n3. What did you use to study? (I’ve found a few YouTube sources via Reddit, going to download the study guide e book, and use google data sets to practice). \n\nAll suggestions and tips welcome!

I’m in the cannabis field. I just got a job as a dispensary manager and inventory manager (2 roles one job). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My excel skills are basic. I worked with pivot tables but never created from scratch. I only understand sum and very basic excel functions. I can fill in and obviously understand and track data but I’ve never built a spreadsheet from scratch. I worked with ERP and SAP systems too but again I only worked on the outside. I was trained how to insert data but never to troubleshoot and learn the barebones. ERP and SAP is so valuable and I’m hitting myself for not learning more when i was at that job! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to take the MOS Excel expert exam to add to my job experience and resume. My job experience is very transferable. I am earning my psych degree and can transfer into multiple fields especially with certification +experience under my belt. I’m most interested in becoming an operations manager. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also would adding a stats minor to my psych degree help? I already need two stats courses to graduate and I got a 93 in the first one. I don’t mind stats but I’m worried a minor will be a waste of time and money (going into 3rd year and my schedule is already stacked so I’d had enough to graduate later). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long did it take to learn excel for you? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did it affect your career/salary ?
