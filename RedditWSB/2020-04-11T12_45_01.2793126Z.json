          "selftext": "TLDR: The IHME model is trash. Media will soon notice. Long volatility via calendars on SPX for low risk high reward.\n\nAll right boys and girls, listen up. Professor BoneMaster's class is now in session. I'm a researcher at a university you've heard of, and I've been following the 'rona closely since January. I told my students to buy SPY puts in mid-February and that the global economy was going to shut down well into the summer only a couple weeks later. I'm up 300% so far by longing volatility, have been mostly cash for the past couple weeks, but am once again confident enough to be back in. As I've now convinced you of my predictive ability, let's get to it.\n\nThesis: The IHME model touted by Trump is bad. It is considerably under-shooting projected death counts. This becoming apparent is a very soon eventuality, which will be the catalyst for the next leg down.\n\nI'm going to try and keep this as simple as possible for the retards. The IHME model works as follows:\n\n1. Assumes cumulative deaths over time follows a curve like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Error\\_Function.svg), but normalized for only positive x,y.\n\n2. Fits parameters that control the shape of the curve for a given location using existing data. Specifically, it fits for the time where rate of change is maximum and the maximum rate itself more-or-less. It then predicts a maximum value based off of that.\n\nSo why is this approach retarded?\n\n1. Assuming a Gaussian-like curve for daily deaths and therefore a sigmoid-like curve for cumulative deaths makes sense in the context of a lot of basic epidemiological (SIR-like) models. We also saw curves like this in Wuhan. We are NOT seeing this in Italy or Spain. See daily infections and deaths for Spain [here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/) and Italy [here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/). What we are seeing is a leveling off of to a plateau/low angle slope. More later.\n\n2. The US models are fitted using data from Wuhan, Italy, and Spain. We are NOT following social distancing as closely as these countries. As others have posted in this sub, see [NY](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05\\_US\\_New\\_York\\_Mobility\\_Report\\_en.pdf) vs [Italy](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05\\_IT\\_Mobility\\_Report\\_en.pdf) vs [Spain](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05\\_ES\\_Mobility\\_Report\\_en.pdf). Americans are stupid and selfish. We aren't social distancing nearly as well as other countries.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n1. For Italy and Spain, the IHME estimates are getting more and more desperate. I've been watching the realized daily deaths blow outside their confidence bounds for the last few updates. For the most recent model from Wednesday, Italy just blew up the model's **UPPER-FUCKING BOUND** today ([570 realized](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/) vs. [522 max](https://covid19.healthdata.org/italy)). Spain is likely going to do it tomorrow or Sunday at the latest. Needless to say, a predictive model that consistently fails to predict two days out within the fucking 95% confidence interval **IS NOT A GOOD MODEL**. \n\n2. The prediction for the U.S. is going to get double fucked. It suffers from the invalid assumption of a nice Gaussian-like curve, plus it's essentially fit using data that paints a much rosier picture than reality. \n\nDeeper dive:\n\nThe model inherently assumes a notable inflection point. This occurred in Wuhan as the strict lockdown essentially killed almost all spread. The looser restrictions within Italy and Spain have kept the disease reproductive number sufficiently high enough to maintain something along the line of a plateau of daily new infections. Neither country is at the point where herd immunity has any effect, so this might be maintained for some amount of time. This could actually be considered the desired effect of flattening the curve, meaning that the restrictions are enough that the disease is under control but not so strict that you're welding people in their houses. \n\nGiven sufficient time, this will result in herd immunity. However, at the current rate, that would take about 25 years for Italy (2.5 years if rate is 10x under-reported, as thought). If this is in fact something of a steady-state, maintaining it also requires that restrictions are also essentially maintained as-is until vaccinations are possible. If the rate is actually plateaued, then even a slight loosening of restrictions will result in an immediate second wave.\n\nWhat I think is actually happening is something along the lines of a self-limiting population-wide response. With bad news people cower in their homes, but with good news (we passed the peak!) people start going back out again. Good/bad news creates a feedback cycle resulting in a steady-state rate of infections that's just low enough to not overwhelm the hospitals. I call this response the \"BoneMaster Effect\". \n\nI think Fauci et al. is well aware of all of this but waiting to break the news. At least, I would certainly fucking hope so. The IHME models for the US have been relatively accurate, as the curve is absolutely a good fit for initial-&gt;peak infections. But as we've only just started to hit the peak in certain areas, the BoneMaster Effect hasn't come into play yet. We have another week or so until IHME says NY infections will reduce by half (https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/new-york), though their confidence interval is fucking absurd. If by next Friday NY is still getting O(600-700) deaths per day, then people are going to take notice.\n\nSummary of other models:\n\nThe CovidActNow model is equally retarded, but in the other direction. It assumes way too high of a reproductive number with social distancing. The only good model with a fancy website I've found is the Los Alamos [one](https://covid-19.bsvgateway.org/). I've been keeping an eye on it, and they've generally been spot on. Basically, they don't make any explicit assumptions about disease growth rate except that it will trend down, then randomly samples over all possibilities of how the growth rate can change over time. This inherently captures that notion of plateau/low angle decreasing slope. More importantly, take a look at the 'team' leading that model and compare them to the original 'team' for CovidActNow vs. IHME. Notice anything? CovidActNow was started by a bunch of business fucks, IHME is like 90% attractive bio girls, but, by far, the Los Alamos team is the biggest group of nerds out there. Always bet on the nerds.\n\n\nUppies or downies:\n\nNeither. Long volatility. Calendar spreads below present value are the way to go along with a debit call spread for capping \"brrrr\" risk. Wait until you see the first article out hinting that Trump's model is completely fucked.\n\nReal TLDR: **A PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT CONSISTENTLY FAILS TO PREDICT TWO DAYS OUT WITHIN THE FUCKING 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL IS NOT A GOOD MODEL. LONG VOLATILITY. BET ON THE NERDS.**",

Long volatility via calendars on SPX for low risk high reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All right boys and girls, listen up. Professor BoneMaster&amp;#39;s class is now in session. I&amp;#39;m a researcher at a university you&amp;#39;ve heard of, and I&amp;#39;ve been following the &amp;#39;rona closely since January. I told my students to buy SPY puts in mid-February and that the global economy was going to shut down well into the summer only a couple weeks later. I&amp;#39;m up 300% so far by longing volatility, have been mostly cash for the past couple weeks, but am once again confident enough to be back in. As I&amp;#39;ve now convinced you of my predictive ability, let&amp;#39;s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thesis: The IHME model touted by Trump is bad. It is considerably under-shooting projected death counts. This becoming apparent is a very soon eventuality, which will be the catalyst for the next leg down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to try and keep this as simple as possible for the retards. The IHME model works as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assumes cumulative deaths over time follows a curve like &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Error_Function.svg\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, but normalized for only positive x,y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fits parameters that control the shape of the curve for a given location using existing data. Specifically, it fits for the time where rate of change is maximum and the maximum rate itself more-or-less. It then predicts a maximum value based off of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why is this approach retarded?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming a Gaussian-like curve for daily deaths and therefore a sigmoid-like curve for cumulative deaths makes sense in the context of a lot of basic epidemiological (SIR-like) models. We also saw curves like this in Wuhan. We are NOT seeing this in Italy or Spain. See daily infections and deaths for Spain &lt;a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and Italy &lt;a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. What we are seeing is a leveling off of to a plateau/low angle slope. More later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US models are fitted using data from Wuhan, Italy, and Spain. We are NOT following social distancing as closely as these countries. As others have posted in this sub, see &lt;a href=\"https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05_US_New_York_Mobility_Report_en.pdf\"&gt;NY&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href=\"https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05_IT_Mobility_Report_en.pdf\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href=\"https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05_ES_Mobility_Report_en.pdf\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. Americans are stupid and selfish. We aren&amp;#39;t social distancing nearly as well as other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Italy and Spain, the IHME estimates are getting more and more desperate. I&amp;#39;ve been watching the realized daily deaths blow outside their confidence bounds for the last few updates. For the most recent model from Wednesday, Italy just blew up the model&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;UPPER-FUCKING BOUND&lt;/strong&gt; today (&lt;a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/\"&gt;570 realized&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href=\"https://covid19.healthdata.org/italy\"&gt;522 max&lt;/a&gt;). Spain is likely going to do it tomorrow or Sunday at the latest. Needless to say, a predictive model that consistently fails to predict two days out within the fucking 95% confidence interval &lt;strong&gt;IS NOT A GOOD MODEL&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prediction for the U.S. is going to get double fucked. It suffers from the invalid assumption of a nice Gaussian-like curve, plus it&amp;#39;s essentially fit using data that paints a much rosier picture than reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deeper dive:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The model inherently assumes a notable inflection point. This occurred in Wuhan as the strict lockdown essentially killed almost all spread. The looser restrictions within Italy and Spain have kept the disease reproductive number sufficiently high enough to maintain something along the line of a plateau of daily new infections. Neither country is at the point where herd immunity has any effect, so this might be maintained for some amount of time. This could actually be considered the desired effect of flattening the curve, meaning that the restrictions are enough that the disease is under control but not so strict that you&amp;#39;re welding people in their houses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given sufficient time, this will result in herd immunity. However, at the current rate, that would take about 25 years for Italy (2.5 years if rate is 10x under-reported, as thought). If this is in fact something of a steady-state, maintaining it also requires that restrictions are also essentially maintained as-is until vaccinations are possible. If the rate is actually plateaued, then even a slight loosening of restrictions will result in an immediate second wave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I think is actually happening is something along the lines of a self-limiting population-wide response. With bad news people cower in their homes, but with good news (we passed the peak!) people start going back out again. Good/bad news creates a feedback cycle resulting in a steady-state rate of infections that&amp;#39;s just low enough to not overwhelm the hospitals. I call this response the &amp;quot;BoneMaster Effect&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think Fauci et al. is well aware of all of this but waiting to break the news. At least, I would certainly fucking hope so. The IHME models for the US have been relatively accurate, as the curve is absolutely a good fit for initial-&amp;gt;peak infections. But as we&amp;#39;ve only just started to hit the peak in certain areas, the BoneMaster Effect hasn&amp;#39;t come into play yet. We have another week or so until IHME says NY infections will reduce by half (&lt;a href=\"https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/new-york\"&gt;https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/new-york&lt;/a&gt;), though their confidence interval is fucking absurd. If by next Friday NY is still getting O(600-700) deaths per day, then people are going to take notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary of other models:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The CovidActNow model is equally retarded, but in the other direction. It assumes way too high of a reproductive number with social distancing. The only good model with a fancy website I&amp;#39;ve found is the Los Alamos &lt;a href=\"https://covid-19.bsvgateway.org/\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve been keeping an eye on it, and they&amp;#39;ve generally been spot on. Basically, they don&amp;#39;t make any explicit assumptions about disease growth rate except that it will trend down, then randomly samples over all possibilities of how the growth rate can change over time. This inherently captures that notion of plateau/low angle decreasing slope. More importantly, take a look at the &amp;#39;team&amp;#39; leading that model and compare them to the original &amp;#39;team&amp;#39; for CovidActNow vs. IHME. Notice anything? CovidActNow was started by a bunch of business fucks, IHME is like 90% attractive bio girls, but, by far, the Los Alamos team is the biggest group of nerds out there. Always bet on the nerds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uppies or downies:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither. Long volatility. Calendar spreads below present value are the way to go along with a debit call spread for capping &amp;quot;brrrr&amp;quot; risk. Wait until you see the first article out hinting that Trump&amp;#39;s model is completely fucked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real TLDR: &lt;strong&gt;A PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT CONSISTENTLY FAILS TO PREDICT TWO DAYS OUT WITHIN THE FUCKING 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL IS NOT A GOOD MODEL. LONG VOLATILITY. BET ON THE NERDS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

So they buy bonds, treasuries, etc. to print them small returns instead of holding cash. They are illiquid as hell. \n\nWhen the market crashed, a lot of these guys, specifically hedge funds, got caught with their smelly panties down and were at risk of getting margin called or did get margin called and the whole fucking thing was about to crash down. The market would have went down another 25%. They had no cash and the repo market had no demand, because any cash that people did have, no one wanted to lend it out because the economy was fucked (still is). In short, think of a repo as when a hedge fund wants cash real quick to buy a call option on Tesla but all their cash is tied up in other equities. So they put the treasury bonds or any other securities on the repo market and they get cold hard cash through a repurchase agreement and make bank on their Tesla call and then give the money back to the issuer of the cash, plus interest. \n\nSo now, JP said how do I stop this free fall and get the markets back in order. I bring back demand for the repo market so hedge funds can get liquid again and start buying up equities with options and make a fuckin killing while all of us cheer on our girlfriends getting railed by their boyfriends, and cry about the lack of tendies from our puts. \n\nSo JP started injecting trillions into the repo market and hedge funds lended out their securities for loads on cold hard cash, bought equities hand over fist, and stopped the market free fall while making a shit load of money on the rebound. Win-win, the fed stopped the bleeding and got paid back on their loan because the hedge funds made bank on the bounce, and a win to the hedge funds because they were saved again from defaulting and now have cash (reserves) to play with and make even more tendies. \n\nSo JP stopped arguably the biggest leveraged/default crash we have ever seen next to the housing crisis overnight by directly engaging in repurchase agreements with hedge funds. Hedge funds/Pension Funds drive the market. \n\nNow that hedge funds are liquid again, they will soon start closing their long positions and go short, because let’s be real, the economy is fucked beyond belief right now and hedge funds are in the business of making lots of tendies. Not much more room to go up, but plenty to go down. JP only stepped in to avoid the banks and hedge funds getting fucked, and once banks are fucked, no one gets any more loans and we all eat shit. Now that those dealers are liquid again, the markets should start to play out as they should when you have 17M unemployed in 3x weeks, no consumer activity, corporations maxing out credit lines about to issue stock at depressed values, and US oil going bankrupt. \n\nSo, hang on to those puts. Hedge funds love making bank bro, and the fastest way to do that is playing the downside. As long as the dealers (banks, hedge funds) don’t get too leveraged again and have access to cash, then JP is going to have to watch the market slow bleed. \n\nNotice on Wednesday/Thursday we started to see some major drops and selling. That is hedge funds taking billions in profits and ready to reverse course for utter destruction. Next week we start the fall. You can count on it.\n\nEdit: Those Kevin Durant replies are just my autist self responding to the thread instead of all of your retarded posts. I realize the irony calling you all retards, in that, I’m actually the retard. But we’ll all forget about this when our tendies print next week (or the week after, or the week after)",

Maybe if you got off tic tok and staring at 1 second charts your attention spans would be better. God this explains the short sightedness in every daily thread.\n\ntl;dr SPY 220p 5/15\n\ntl;dr of edit: I love you all and wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.\n\nDo you not know what the fuck happened in 2008? Haven’t read a book ever since you graduated to develop the skills necessary to know what happened? Look no further. Here is a ELI5ish version of what happened.\n\nYou have lemonade stand. You have $10. You buy ingredients for $5. You make the lemonade and sell the lemonade for 10 cents each. \n\nAfter many months you now have $15. You say no, I want more than $15. You buy cheaper and cheaper ingredients and raise prices so people buy. They don’t like it, but no one has enough money to make lemonade themselves outright so they buy from you bc they have no choice. \n\nPeople watch this from across the street and come to you to buy insurance. What kind of insurance? Well you know, the more people who buy, the more chance there is of them getting sick. So in the event they get sick from food poisoning, the people from across the street get paid. Insurance costs $1 and if someone does get sick then you pay them $10. Who the hell is going to get sick from lemonade? And how are they going to get the blame? It could be anything that made them sick? It’s free money. Why aren’t the people who are buying the fucking lemonade not buying insurance? They don’t even know it exists, if they do then they don’t even have access to buy it.\n\nSo now you are making money from selling lemonade at higher prices with cheaper ingredients and selling insurance for an event that will not only never happen, but if it does there is no proof it was your fault. Ah. The American dream. \n\nYou make hundreds of dollars from this. But you say no, I want more than hundreds of dollars. You buy ingredients from that shady Russian guy who always seems to be mumbling to himself. Your fellow lemonade stand owners see this and hop on the bandwagon. Why not. It’s cheap af and since you’ve spent so little on ingredients you can feed more people. Yay! Some people get sick but it’s all good, it’s flu season so you don’t get any blame. \n\nPeople are still concerned though. So you pay your friend Timmy’s dad who is a doctor to tell everyone the ingredients are fine and perfect. Delicious. The doctor knows that the ingredients are not good for you but if he doesn’t say they are good then you’ll tell your dad that the doctor is fucking your mom. So the doctor complies. \n\nPerfect! Low ingredient cost, high margins, selling insurance which will never pay out because the doctor says everything is fine! But twist! Ingredients turn out defective. People start getting sick, very sick. The people who bought insurance want their money. You sold $20,000 of insurance that would pay $100,000s if people were to get sick. But you only have $10,000. You become sad. But wait! Idea! You pay the doctor some more to get his friends to pay other doctors to do the same thing. Problem solved! \n\nThe people who want their insurance payout get mad and know something is up. You know it won’t last forever. So you get an amazing idea! Let me buy insurance from other lemonade stands and the people across the street. After all, lemonade stands are doing the same thing I am. Shitty ingredients, blackmailing Timmy’s dad, the whole 9. So you do just that, knowing that when it all goes down you’ll be rich from these insurance payouts. And if you don’t you’ll get rich from your lemonade stand and from selling insurance.\n\nSo you raise the price of insurance from $1 to $100. You use the $100 to buy insurance from other lemonade stands. Insurance buyers are getting skeptical since you’re saying everything is fine, but you’re raising the price of insurance like some shit is about to go down, so they comply and pay the increased price, doubling down knowing that shit is about to hit the fan.\n\nFast forward a couple fiscal quarters of you buying shittier and shittier ingredients, selling and buying more and more expensive insurance while buying insurance from other lemonade stands. You’re leveraged to the tits. You’re running out of healthy people to sell lemonade to since there’s only so many healthy people. You didn’t want them to get sick but now you’ll profit off of it so you start selling to people who would more effected by food poisoning. The elderly, people with underlying conditions etc. etc. You don’t want everything to go tits up but are in a great position if it does, so you might as well enjoy the ride and make as much money as you can. Don’t worry about the risk, that’s covered.\n\nFast forward another few fiscal quarters with more everything happening. You realize the house of cards is about to fall and you’re going to be rich from all the insurance you bought from the other lemonade stands. But then reality hits you. You learn to read (you’re in 1st grade now I guess or whenever kids learn to read) and you find out on the insurance receipts that other lemonade stands are ALSO buying insurance from you, in large quantities. If everyone’s as leveraged as you are, then no one is making any money. \n\nIf you get a bunch of money from insurance payouts, then you gotta pay insurance payouts to all the other lemonade stands and other people across the street as well. It’s a 0 sum game. You know this collapse is inevitable, the entire lemonade market is about to be destroyed. \n\nAnd it does. Mass amounts of people start getting sick, there is more than sufficient evidence that it came from your lemonade, which was made from shit ingredients, from shady ass people, backed by insurance that was bought by other lemonade stands and yeah, some people from across the street. And surprise surprise, there’s no money to pay out the insurance, and other lemonade stands also don’t have money to payout the insurance you bought. And as it turns out, people were buying insurance on whether or not the people across the street would get paid out or not. And people were betting on those guys. And these guys are stupid and believe these doctors and lemonade stands so they’re on the other side of this insurance betting. They bet everything will be A OK. No chance this shit goes tits up it’s free money, who cares if these bets are 20 to 1 or 50 to fucking 1 odds. There’s no chance something that has never ever happened happens. This spanned the entire town. Everyone had skin in the game and it was all coming down. Even people 2 towns over were being affected. \n\nIt’s all over. Everything is over. Everyone dies or goes broke. But wait! Your parents give you a couple billion dollars to payout the insurance you sold as well and get you back on your feet and give compensation to the people who were sick from your lemonade. \n\nDo you you give money to people who are sick? Hahaha no you write yourself a fat bonus check. Other lemonade stands’ parents also give their kids a couple billion dollars to get back up and running again and everything is now fine and dandy.\n\nYou turned a collapsing system into you and your buddies getting rich, while the poor became poorer from buying your shit lemonade and now bc they got sick or died they can’t open their own stands to do what you’re doing. Small stands get smaller and bigger ones get bigger. And your dad doesn’t even give a fuck that Timmy’s dad is fucking your mom because he is a literal cuck. He knew what was happening the whole time and was trying to keep things under wraps behind the scenes. Are you in trouble? Nah you’re too important. Go chill on your yacht for a bit. You deserve it after having to sign that bonus check paid for by the very people who got sick from your lemonade. (Signing checks are hard. You’re in the 1st grade remember)\n\nWhile day drinking and doing coke off of hookers’ tits, you get an idea! If your parents will keep giving you money if you get yourself in a mess because of how important you are, then nothing is stopping you from doing it again. And so you will. Like idk maybe have the fed BUY YOUR JUNK FUCKING BONDS.\n\n\n**You/lemonade stands = banks**\n\n**Ingredients = mortgages and mortgage bonds**\n\n**Lemonade = houses**\n\n**Higher prices = higher interest rates**\n\n**Getting sick = defaulting on mortgage payments**\n\n**Insurance = credit default swaps**\n\n**Timmy = Timothy Baker from my 7th grade math class who broke my nose. Fuck you Timmy I hope your parents divorced.**\n\n**Shady Russian guy(s) = greedy mortgage brokers**\n\n**Doctors = ratings agencies**\n\n**Blame shifting = literally blame anything idk poor people and immigrants I guess**\n\n**People across street = Wall Street and those weirdos from the big short**\n\n**People betting on people across street = general retail investors.**\n\n**Other stands = other industries**\n\n**Town(s) = countries**\n\n**Your parents = feds**\n\n**American dream = greed**\n\n———————————————————————\n\nOk my addy is just about done sooo. Ya.\n\n\ntl;dr: SPY 220p 5/15\n\nMake depressions great again",

You sold $20,000 of insurance that would pay $100,000s if people were to get sick. But you only have $10,000. You become sad. But wait! Idea! You pay the doctor some more to get his friends to pay other doctors to do the same thing. Problem solved! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people who want their insurance payout get mad and know something is up. You know it won’t last forever. So you get an amazing idea! Let me buy insurance from other lemonade stands and the people across the street. After all, lemonade stands are doing the same thing I am. Shitty ingredients, blackmailing Timmy’s dad, the whole 9. So you do just that, knowing that when it all goes down you’ll be rich from these insurance payouts. And if you don’t you’ll get rich from your lemonade stand and from selling insurance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you raise the price of insurance from $1 to $100. You use the $100 to buy insurance from other lemonade stands. Insurance buyers are getting skeptical since you’re saying everything is fine, but you’re raising the price of insurance like some shit is about to go down, so they comply and pay the increased price, doubling down knowing that shit is about to hit the fan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a couple fiscal quarters of you buying shittier and shittier ingredients, selling and buying more and more expensive insurance while buying insurance from other lemonade stands. You’re leveraged to the tits. You’re running out of healthy people to sell lemonade to since there’s only so many healthy people. You didn’t want them to get sick but now you’ll profit off of it so you start selling to people who would more effected by food poisoning. The elderly, people with underlying conditions etc. etc. You don’t want everything to go tits up but are in a great position if it does, so you might as well enjoy the ride and make as much money as you can. Don’t worry about the risk, that’s covered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward another few fiscal quarters with more everything happening. You realize the house of cards is about to fall and you’re going to be rich from all the insurance you bought from the other lemonade stands. But then reality hits you. You learn to read (you’re in 1st grade now I guess or whenever kids learn to read) and you find out on the insurance receipts that other lemonade stands are ALSO buying insurance from you, in large quantities. If everyone’s as leveraged as you are, then no one is making any money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get a bunch of money from insurance payouts, then you gotta pay insurance payouts to all the other lemonade stands and other people across the street as well. It’s a 0 sum game. You know this collapse is inevitable, the entire lemonade market is about to be destroyed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it does. Mass amounts of people start getting sick, there is more than sufficient evidence that it came from your lemonade, which was made from shit ingredients, from shady ass people, backed by insurance that was bought by other lemonade stands and yeah, some people from across the street. And surprise surprise, there’s no money to pay out the insurance, and other lemonade stands also don’t have money to payout the insurance you bought. And as it turns out, people were buying insurance on whether or not the people across the street would get paid out or not. And people were betting on those guys. And these guys are stupid and believe these doctors and lemonade stands so they’re on the other side of this insurance betting. They bet everything will be A OK. No chance this shit goes tits up it’s free money, who cares if these bets are 20 to 1 or 50 to fucking 1 odds. There’s no chance something that has never ever happened happens. This spanned the entire town. Everyone had skin in the game and it was all coming down. Even people 2 towns over were being affected. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s all over. Everything is over. Everyone dies or goes broke. But wait! Your parents give you a couple billion dollars to payout the insurance you sold as well and get you back on your feet and give compensation to the people who were sick from your lemonade. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you you give money to people who are sick? Hahaha no you write yourself a fat bonus check. Other lemonade stands’ parents also give their kids a couple billion dollars to get back up and running again and everything is now fine and dandy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You turned a collapsing system into you and your buddies getting rich, while the poor became poorer from buying your shit lemonade and now bc they got sick or died they can’t open their own stands to do what you’re doing. Small stands get smaller and bigger ones get bigger. And your dad doesn’t even give a fuck that Timmy’s dad is fucking your mom because he is a literal cuck. He knew what was happening the whole time and was trying to keep things under wraps behind the scenes. Are you in trouble? Nah you’re too important. Go chill on your yacht for a bit. You deserve it after having to sign that bonus check paid for by the very people who got sick from your lemonade. (Signing checks are hard. You’re in the 1st grade remember)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While day drinking and doing coke off of hookers’ tits, you get an idea! If your parents will keep giving you money if you get yourself in a mess because of how important you are, then nothing is stopping you from doing it again. And so you will. Like idk maybe have the fed BUY YOUR JUNK FUCKING BONDS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You/lemonade stands = banks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients = mortgages and mortgage bonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemonade = houses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher prices = higher interest rates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting sick = defaulting on mortgage payments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insurance = credit default swaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timmy = Timothy Baker from my 7th grade math class who broke my nose. Fuck you Timmy I hope your parents divorced.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shady Russian guy(s) = greedy mortgage brokers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctors = ratings agencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blame shifting = literally blame anything idk poor people and immigrants I guess&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People across street = Wall Street and those weirdos from the big short&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People betting on people across street = general retail investors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other stands = other industries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Town(s) = countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your parents = feds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American dream = greed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;———————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok my addy is just about done sooo.

Smart parents, but still grew up poor because it works better for the story. \n\n\nYou graduate college with an engineering degree like your Dad. You get a good job in the Midwest making slightly over 50K. Over the years you put in over 50 hour weeks and move up the ranks. You're almost making 100K a year. \n\n\nFast forward to 2020. You've been working hard the past few years. Meanwhile executives at an airline corporation have been jacked to the tits on cocaine. They've been putting in 50 hour weeks on their yacht. They don't have to work very hard because all they have to do is buyback their own stock. \n\n\nA fisherman pulls up beside the yacht in a dingy. He yells \"I noticed you announced a 10 billion stock buyback program, yet you are selling personal holdings of the company stock. It doesn't make any sense.\" \n\n\nThe executives laugh, and whip out their dicks so they can piss on the fisherman. \n\n\nThe executives come back to shore from a 25 day cocaine binge. A virus has spread. They all rush back to the office. Their planes are literally flying with 5 passengers per flight. They all of a sudden have no more cash to keep the corporation afloat. They spent all the cash on buybacks. What are they going to do? \n\n\nThey pull out a top secret envelope. It's a list of middle class workers. Hugo is third on the list. An executive says \"Pick Hugo, he sounds like a poor person\". Hugo's tax dollars just got selected to fund the airline bailout. The executives continue to scroll down the list. They have 50 million more Americans to choose.",

Your father is an engineer. Smart parents, but still grew up poor because it works better for the story. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You graduate college with an engineering degree like your Dad. You get a good job in the Midwest making slightly over 50K. Over the years you put in over 50 hour weeks and move up the ranks. You&amp;#39;re almost making 100K a year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2020. You&amp;#39;ve been working hard the past few years. Meanwhile executives at an airline corporation have been jacked to the tits on cocaine. They&amp;#39;ve been putting in 50 hour weeks on their yacht. They don&amp;#39;t have to work very hard because all they have to do is buyback their own stock. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A fisherman pulls up beside the yacht in a dingy. He yells &amp;quot;I noticed you announced a 10 billion stock buyback program, yet you are selling personal holdings of the company stock. It doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The executives laugh, and whip out their dicks so they can piss on the fisherman. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The executives come back to shore from a 25 day cocaine binge. A virus has spread. They all rush back to the office. Their planes are literally flying with 5 passengers per flight. They all of a sudden have no more cash to keep the corporation afloat. They spent all the cash on buybacks. What are they going to do? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They pull out a top secret envelope. It&amp;#39;s a list of middle class workers. Hugo is third on the list. An executive says &amp;quot;Pick Hugo, he sounds like a poor person&amp;quot;. Hugo&amp;#39;s tax dollars just got selected to fund the airline bailout. The executives continue to scroll down the list. They have 50 million more Americans to choose.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Wall street retards were panicking and selling everything at the same time. You know what they shouldn't have sold? Motherfucking potatoes. Hear me out.\n\n* potatoes are by far the most profitable food, they have the highest profit margin of anything\n* if the market recovers, restaurants will go up, potatoes go up\n* if the market drops, everyone except fast food will go out of business, they're the largest purchasers of potatoes, potatoes go up\n* if we enter a depression, all we'll be able to afford is potatoes, potatoes go up\n* every restaurant will make their menu have the best possible margins if they want to survive, which means potatoes go up\n* massively OTM calls on potatoes are cheap as fuck\n\nThere's no future without potatoes. A day without a potato is like a day without sunshine. The stock is LW. Biggest supplier of potatoes. It's going to hit $85 by August 21st. If it doesn't I'll double penetrate myself with sharpies. I'll probably do that anyways.\n\nSo click the \"select\" button in robinhood which makes all the little checkboxes appear. Buy a call for October 16th, strike price 85. Sell a call for August 21st, strike price 85. I've done all the math and technical shit with charts and lines and I squiggled dry erase markers on a window for like three hours but I'm not gonna get into the details because they're boring. But this strategy has 10x upside and zero downside. Worst case you end up at only 250%, jerking off to a picture of like six neon green sharpies inside of me, wondering what would've happened if you had doubled down on SPY 300 calls expiring 45 seconds after market open.\n\nhere's proof that I'm an experienced trader with over 30 days of experience:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mjnnpzf575s41.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0e9e3e9e4ce193900173764b2e6f6c57884327b\n\ntl;dr: buy LW 85C 10/16, sell LW 85C 8/21",

How does that make you feel? Stressed out? Do you know what people do when they&amp;#39;re stressed and poor? They eat fast food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been on the lookout for stocks that dropped with the crash but really shouldn&amp;#39;t have. Wall street retards were panicking and selling everything at the same time. You know what they shouldn&amp;#39;t have sold? Motherfucking potatoes. Hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;potatoes are by far the most profitable food, they have the highest profit margin of anything&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;if the market recovers, restaurants will go up, potatoes go up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;if the market drops, everyone except fast food will go out of business, they&amp;#39;re the largest purchasers of potatoes, potatoes go up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;if we enter a depression, all we&amp;#39;ll be able to afford is potatoes, potatoes go up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;every restaurant will make their menu have the best possible margins if they want to survive, which means potatoes go up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;massively OTM calls on potatoes are cheap as fuck&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no future without potatoes. A day without a potato is like a day without sunshine. The stock is LW. Biggest supplier of potatoes. It&amp;#39;s going to hit $85 by August 21st. If it doesn&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;ll double penetrate myself with sharpies. I&amp;#39;ll probably do that anyways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So click the &amp;quot;select&amp;quot; button in robinhood which makes all the little checkboxes appear. Buy a call for October 16th, strike price 85. Sell a call for August 21st, strike price 85. I&amp;#39;ve done all the math and technical shit with charts and lines and I squiggled dry erase markers on a window for like three hours but I&amp;#39;m not gonna get into the details because they&amp;#39;re boring. But this strategy has 10x upside and zero downside. Worst case you end up at only 250%, jerking off to a picture of like six neon green sharpies inside of me, wondering what would&amp;#39;ve happened if you had doubled down on SPY 300 calls expiring 45 seconds after market open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;here&amp;#39;s proof that I&amp;#39;m an experienced trader with over 30 days of experience:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mjnnpzf575s41.png?width=1080&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a0e9e3e9e4ce193900173764b2e6f6c57884327b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mjnnpzf575s41.png?width=1080&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a0e9e3e9e4ce193900173764b2e6f6c57884327b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: buy LW 85C 10/16, sell LW 85C 8/21&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "# What Happened?\n\nThere’s been so much news these past few months, especially in March, that it’s easy to lose track of everything that’s going on. Let’s take a step back and look at what happened the past month and a half with SPY prices and see how these relate to COVID-19 events, and fiscal + monetary response\n\n**Blissful Ignorance**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dmt7rorrv3s41.png?width=1462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a52b0b3cf86f727a137211c94b7dc0f236aac4f\n\nDec 31 - COVID-19 is reported to the WHO\n\nJan 20 - Human to human transmission confirmed\n\nJan 21 - First case in the US\n\nJan 23 - Wuhan + surrounding areas locked down\n\nJan 30 - COVID-19 declared international health emergency by WHO\n\nJan 31 - China travel ban\n\nFeb 15 - China lockdown expanded to cover 760M people\n\nFeb 17 - Apple warns it will miss guidance due to COVID-19\n\nFeb 19 - New ATH @ 339.08\n\nIn hindsight, there were a lot of signs that something bad was about to happen. China locked down half of its population, and all the signs that this will be spreading to other countries were there. Even without it affecting other countries, the fact that half of China, the supply chain of the world, shut down should have been enough to cause stocks to go down. Yet due to normalcy bias, even as Apple already started giving warnings that it’s going to be hurting their earnings, SPY kept going up towards reaching new ATHs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**First signs of trouble**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wra2mt3tv3s41.png?width=388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc1013875f0854d383a1a549b367094dae7a7b68\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeb 24 - Gap down approx. 2.5%, the first definitive bearish signal\n\nFeb 28 - After dropping over 15% from ATH, bull trap starts\n\nFeb 29 - First US death\n\nMar 3 - Fed 50bps rate cut\n\nMar 4 - First coronavirus bill passed, aimed at funding public health (8.3B)\n\nMar 4 - Bull trap ends, almost recovering 10% from Feb 28 lows and 8% from ATH\n\nThe weekend before Feb 24 saw COVID-19 cases pop up in a lot of new countries. This probably prompted some of the smarter investors to start realizing it will come to North America too and negatively impact the economy. The sudden shock of selling inevitably led towards a dead cat bounce with the still-bullish investors “buying the dip” thinking that it will be business as usual in a few months when this virus goes away. Again, normalcy bias is very hard to break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Panic**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uvfo4jwtv3s41.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0024f034748a3de12e43763bfc7c639543f2792d\n\nMar 6 - SXSW cancelled (first major event)\n\nMar 11 - Pandemic declared; Europe travel ban; NBA suspended\n\nMar 12 - States begin banning large gatherings of people; Schools start closing\n\nMar 15 - 100bps rate cut to 0%, starts $80B QE round and capital reqs for banks relaxed\n\nMar 17 - First shelter-in-place order from SF; Fed to buy commercial paper\n\nMar 18 - Second coronavirus bill passed, aimed at testing and funding sick leave (104B)\n\nMar 23 - Reached low of 218.26, a 35% drop from ATH, new rally starts; Fed launches unlimited QE, buying of IG bonds &amp; MBS, and lending to small businesses\n\nThis period started when many events, notably SXSW, being cancelled, which will obviously hurt economic activity. Mar 11 is when shit starts to get crazy as a pandemic is declared. People start realizing that the virus is going to hurt the economy and earnings as it starts impacting their daily lives, especially as lockdowns start being discussed, the first of which occurs in Mar 17. Panic selling starts because anyone with a brain can figure out that being unable to leave your home for months will cause the economy to crash, bringing the stock market with it. The decline is exasperated by a liquidity crunch and financial deleveraging. Initial fiscal and monetary policies seem to have no effect, at least until infinite QE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Money printer goes brrr**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dx91fa9vv3s41.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=244823c67af269a3c1a45904058fac4da765bcd9\n\nMar 26 - US #1 in cases; 3.2M jobless claims\n\nMar 27 - Third coronavirus bill passed, basically bailing out everyone (2T)\n\nApr 2 - 6.6M jobless claims\n\nApr 9 - Fed to buy junk bonds; 7.5M jobless claims; We’re 28% from the lows, or 18% down from ATH\n\nAt this point, most of the US service economy has been shut down. The only significant news here is observing the fallout of the events that led us here - COVID-19 numbers and joblessness claims being the most significant. Meanwhile, fiscal and monetary policies ramped up to unprecedented levels, with the largest stimulus bill in history being passed with speed that would be unimaginable in the gridlocked congress. To put this in perspective, the Great Recession stimulus bill only got passed after Obama’s inauguration, months after the damage has already been done, and was voted almost on party lines.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fed is doing things that people didn’t even know was possible. Everyone thought that the Fed has “run out of bullets” once interest rates hit 0%. Now, not only are they doing infinite QE, but they’re inventing new ways to give entities money to bail them out, like buying corporate and junk bonds. The Fed’s response addressed the liquidity crunch and the impending corporate debt explosion. Combined with the federal government’s rare and surprising unity and speed in getting things done, something which most people in America have given up hope in, markets begin the rally we see now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why the stock market is irrational\n\nThere’s two famous quotes that can explain why the markets are currently in a bull market, up 28% from the lows, defying all logic and instinct.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**“Buy the rumor, sell the news”**\n\nPretty much everyone expected the past few weeks to have very negative economic data. That’s why there was such a spectacular crash in between Mar 6 - 23. That’s when major events started to get cancelled and the first states started to shut down. By that point almost any competent investor can see the writing on the wall that this was going to be bad, almost every state will need to eventually lock down, and there will be mass economic devastation. By Mar 26, we’ve pretty much reached max fear with everyone already expecting economic armageddon. At that point, there were no new negative surprises than can shock the market even more and cause it to go lower. Sure, joblessness figures may have been worse than expected, but the investors who might have sold from those figures already have done so weeks ago. All this data has already been priced in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**“Be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful”**\n\nLet’s think about how the stock market works, and what makes stock prices move up and down when there’s a large amount of uncertainty about earnings. On a basic level, stocks move up when bears become bulls, covering their shorts and / or buying stocks, and stocks move down when bulls become bears when people sell their stock.\n\nUsually stock prices are mainly influenced by fundamentals and things like revenue and earnings meant something and largely determined stock prices. The virus has put fundamentals in the back seat, especially as almost every company retract their guidance and everything becomes impossible to forecast and price in. The stock market starts to lose price discovery and all the stocks (except for ZOOM and ZM) start to move in the same direction. Even AMZN, which would presumably only gain from people forced to stay at home, dropped 25% from its ATH. The stock market is now being driven by sentiment rather than the now unpredictable fundamentals.\n\nLet’s look at the AAII investor sentiment graph, which measures the spread between the number of bullish and bearish investors. It is also a contrarian indicator; we’ll talk more about what that means below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eksjqh3wv3s41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=686fffeebf3a7f14bb2f50ef9e8b387ad94659b4\n\nWe can see here that the market was bullish, except for a quick drop-off in late-Jan to early-Feb, presumably due to the first wave of news about a mysterious virus from Wuhan, up until the ATH on Feb 19.\n\nAs some of these bulls start to realize the virus will probably affect supply chains in China, seeing how half of the country was locked down by then, and market sentiment became bearish starting in late Feb for a quick moment until going back up to neutral at Mar 5. This coincides with the first drop off and bull trap we see in the same time frame.\n\nAfter that we see market sentiment drop off quickly again towards bearish sentiment, peaking at -21% and slowly recovering, with it at -8% as of April 9. Let’s think about what’s been going on in the news lately. We had pretty much had a constant flood of unexpected bad news come in March and made everyone bears. We haven’t seen a quick rebound in sentiment like we did in early March because it’s pretty hard to say the economy and stock market is going to be fine when your city is literally locked down and all economic activity around you has stopped.\n\nSo why isn’t the stock market going up? Because the people that would have sold from all the negative economic news that has been coming out like the joblessness numbers would have already sold all that they have wanted by now. Meanwhile, some of the bears that have shorted the market or sold all their stocks are seeing the stock market rise and the Fed pumping trillions of dollars into the market. Slowly, they are converting these bears into bulls as they reach their pain threshold in their shorts and don’t want to miss out on “buying the dip”, hence increasing stock prices. This is why they call it a bull trap, and stock won’t go down again until there are enough bulls that get scared again and sell the stock they just bought.\n\n**TLDR; A virus happened. Stock market went up, down, up, down, and up again. Will eventually go down again once enough 🌈🐻turn their 💎🙌to  🧻🙌. Always inverse** r/wallstreetbets. **SPY 4/17 280c, SPY 5/15 250p**",

Let’s take a step back and look at what happened the past month and a half with SPY prices and see how these relate to COVID-19 events, and fiscal + monetary response&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blissful Ignorance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dmt7rorrv3s41.png?width=1462&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1a52b0b3cf86f727a137211c94b7dc0f236aac4f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/dmt7rorrv3s41.png?width=1462&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1a52b0b3cf86f727a137211c94b7dc0f236aac4f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dec 31 - COVID-19 is reported to the WHO&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jan 20 - Human to human transmission confirmed&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jan 21 - First case in the US&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jan 23 - Wuhan + surrounding areas locked down&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jan 30 - COVID-19 declared international health emergency by WHO&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jan 31 - China travel ban&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feb 15 - China lockdown expanded to cover 760M people&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feb 17 - Apple warns it will miss guidance due to COVID-19&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feb 19 - New ATH @ 339.08&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, there were a lot of signs that something bad was about to happen. China locked down half of its population, and all the signs that this will be spreading to other countries were there. Even without it affecting other countries, the fact that half of China, the supply chain of the world, shut down should have been enough to cause stocks to go down. Yet due to normalcy bias, even as Apple already started giving warnings that it’s going to be hurting their earnings, SPY kept going up towards reaching new ATHs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First signs of trouble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wra2mt3tv3s41.png?width=388&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dc1013875f0854d383a1a549b367094dae7a7b68\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/wra2mt3tv3s41.png?width=388&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dc1013875f0854d383a1a549b367094dae7a7b68&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feb 24 - Gap down approx. 2.5%, the first definitive bearish signal&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feb 28 - After dropping over 15% from ATH, bull trap starts&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feb 29 - First US death&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mar 3 - Fed 50bps rate cut&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mar 4 - First coronavirus bill passed, aimed at funding public health (8.3B)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mar 4 - Bull trap ends, almost recovering 10% from Feb 28 lows and 8% from ATH&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The weekend before Feb 24 saw COVID-19 cases pop up in a lot of new countries. This probably prompted some of the smarter investors to start realizing it will come to North America too and negatively impact the economy. The sudden shock of selling inevitably led towards a dead cat bounce with the still-bullish investors “buying the dip” thinking that it will be business as usual in a few months when this virus goes away. Again, normalcy bias is very hard to break.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uvfo4jwtv3s41.png?width=764&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0024f034748a3de12e43763bfc7c639543f2792d\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/uvfo4jwtv3s41.png?width=764&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0024f034748a3de12e43763bfc7c639543f2792d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mar 6 - SXSW cancelled (first major event)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mar 11 - Pandemic declared; Europe travel ban; NBA suspended&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mar 12 - States begin banning large gatherings of people; Schools start closing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mar 15 - 100bps rate cut to 0%, starts $80B QE round and capital reqs for banks relaxed&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mar 17 - First shelter-in-place order from SF; Fed to buy commercial paper&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mar 18 - Second coronavirus bill passed, aimed at testing and funding sick leave (104B)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mar 23 - Reached low of 218.26, a 35% drop from ATH, new rally starts; Fed launches unlimited QE, buying of IG bonds &amp;amp; MBS, and lending to small businesses&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This period started when many events, notably SXSW, being cancelled, which will obviously hurt economic activity. Mar 11 is when shit starts to get crazy as a pandemic is declared. People start realizing that the virus is going to hurt the economy and earnings as it starts impacting their daily lives, especially as lockdowns start being discussed, the first of which occurs in Mar 17. Panic selling starts because anyone with a brain can figure out that being unable to leave your home for months will cause the economy to crash, bringing the stock market with it. The decline is exasperated by a liquidity crunch and financial deleveraging. Initial fiscal and monetary policies seem to have no effect, at least until infinite QE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money printer goes brrr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dx91fa9vv3s41.png?width=790&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=244823c67af269a3c1a45904058fac4da765bcd9\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/dx91fa9vv3s41.png?width=790&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=244823c67af269a3c1a45904058fac4da765bcd9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mar 26 - US #1 in cases; 3.2M jobless claims&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mar 27 - Third coronavirus bill passed, basically bailing out everyone (2T)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apr 2 - 6.6M jobless claims&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apr 9 - Fed to buy junk bonds; 7.5M jobless claims; We’re 28% from the lows, or 18% down from ATH&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, most of the US service economy has been shut down. The only significant news here is observing the fallout of the events that led us here - COVID-19 numbers and joblessness claims being the most significant. Meanwhile, fiscal and monetary policies ramped up to unprecedented levels, with the largest stimulus bill in history being passed with speed that would be unimaginable in the gridlocked congress. To put this in perspective, the Great Recession stimulus bill only got passed after Obama’s inauguration, months after the damage has already been done, and was voted almost on party lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Fed is doing things that people didn’t even know was possible. Everyone thought that the Fed has “run out of bullets” once interest rates hit 0%. Now, not only are they doing infinite QE, but they’re inventing new ways to give entities money to bail them out, like buying corporate and junk bonds. The Fed’s response addressed the liquidity crunch and the impending corporate debt explosion. Combined with the federal government’s rare and surprising unity and speed in getting things done, something which most people in America have given up hope in, markets begin the rally we see now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Why the stock market is irrational&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There’s two famous quotes that can explain why the markets are currently in a bull market, up 28% from the lows, defying all logic and instinct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Buy the rumor, sell the news”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everyone expected the past few weeks to have very negative economic data. That’s why there was such a spectacular crash in between Mar 6 - 23. That’s when major events started to get cancelled and the first states started to shut down. By that point almost any competent investor can see the writing on the wall that this was going to be bad, almost every state will need to eventually lock down, and there will be mass economic devastation. By Mar 26, we’ve pretty much reached max fear with everyone already expecting economic armageddon. At that point, there were no new negative surprises than can shock the market even more and cause it to go lower. Sure, joblessness figures may have been worse than expected, but the investors who might have sold from those figures already have done so weeks ago. All this data has already been priced in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about how the stock market works, and what makes stock prices move up and down when there’s a large amount of uncertainty about earnings. On a basic level, stocks move up when bears become bulls, covering their shorts and / or buying stocks, and stocks move down when bulls become bears when people sell their stock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually stock prices are mainly influenced by fundamentals and things like revenue and earnings meant something and largely determined stock prices. The virus has put fundamentals in the back seat, especially as almost every company retract their guidance and everything becomes impossible to forecast and price in. The stock market starts to lose price discovery and all the stocks (except for ZOOM and ZM) start to move in the same direction. Even AMZN, which would presumably only gain from people forced to stay at home, dropped 25% from its ATH. The stock market is now being driven by sentiment rather than the now unpredictable fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the AAII investor sentiment graph, which measures the spread between the number of bullish and bearish investors. It is also a contrarian indicator; we’ll talk more about what that means below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eksjqh3wv3s41.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=686fffeebf3a7f14bb2f50ef9e8b387ad94659b4\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/eksjqh3wv3s41.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=686fffeebf3a7f14bb2f50ef9e8b387ad94659b4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can see here that the market was bullish, except for a quick drop-off in late-Jan to early-Feb, presumably due to the first wave of news about a mysterious virus from Wuhan, up until the ATH on Feb 19.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As some of these bulls start to realize the virus will probably affect supply chains in China, seeing how half of the country was locked down by then, and market sentiment became bearish starting in late Feb for a quick moment until going back up to neutral at Mar 5. This coincides with the first drop off and bull trap we see in the same time frame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that we see market sentiment drop off quickly again towards bearish sentiment, peaking at -21% and slowly recovering, with it at -8% as of April 9. Let’s think about what’s been going on in the news lately. We had pretty much had a constant flood of unexpected bad news come in March and made everyone bears. We haven’t seen a quick rebound in sentiment like we did in early March because it’s pretty hard to say the economy and stock market is going to be fine when your city is literally locked down and all economic activity around you has stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why isn’t the stock market going up? Because the people that would have sold from all the negative economic news that has been coming out like the joblessness numbers would have already sold all that they have wanted by now. Meanwhile, some of the bears that have shorted the market or sold all their stocks are seeing the stock market rise and the Fed pumping trillions of dollars into the market. Slowly, they are converting these bears into bulls as they reach their pain threshold in their shorts and don’t want to miss out on “buying the dip”, hence increasing stock prices. This is why they call it a bull trap, and stock won’t go down again until there are enough bulls that get scared again and sell the stock they just bought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR; A virus happened. Stock market went up, down, up, down, and up again. Will eventually go down again once enough 🌈🐻turn their 💎🙌to  🧻🙌.

          "selftext": "In a nutshell, we  have a huge global oil supply glut because everything is on lock down  (mainly China).\n\nOil prices have cratered from $70/brl in Jan to $22/brl right now. Saudi  Arabia can survive on this. Russia can go broke slow on this. American  shale dies at this level. So SA &amp; Russia are playing a little footsy  to keep prices down and bankrupt the American shale patches, even  though they absolutely hate each other. But they want that China market  share. Trump knows this and has been doing everything he can to broker a  deal to cut production to get oil prices up. Why? Becuz - our energy  sector in the US (especially the oil sector) is leveraged up their ass  with debt. So much debt, living paycheck to paycheck with bank loans.  Banks are ready to take possession of the smaller companies already kind  of debt.\n\nYou think we've seen a stock market slide? Companies like  Chesapeake and Marathon are probably goners. If that goes up the food  chain to COP or XOM, and they default? (They aren't in the stimulus  package btw, so that would require even more bailout) This stock market  goes tits the \\*\\*\\*\\* up and 45 can kiss 2020 election good bye.\n\nSO. OPEC+  and Russia got together with a bunch of other oil countries (Not the US,  because we have antitrust laws and don't play the monopoly price game)  and agreed to a massive oil production cut to try to stabilize oil  prices. Everyone played nice except Mexico. You probably think Mexico  doesn't matter in this game. But they do. They wanted Mexico to take a  400,000 barrel a day cut as part of the whole 10M/brl a day cut that the  whole group wants to accomplish. Problem. Mexico is hedged up the ass  against oil price crashes (they're like the only one) and said go \\*\\*\\*\\*  yourselves. We're printing money and we like that. So they said, we'll  do 100,000 brls/day cause we want to play ball and there's a global  pandemic. SA said \\*\\*\\*\\* you, no deal.\n\nSo Trump jumps in and says, the US  will make up the 300,000 barrels a day that Mexico won't so can we have  deal plz? SA says \\*\\*\\*\\* you. Why? Because we have never told oil  producers how much they can drill for or not drill for becuz capitalism.  We produce enough oil to have a seat at the oil table with OPEC and  Russia, but we don't play those games. So, the question is - does the  federal government mandate our private oil companies cut production to  make up for Mexico's share to get the deal done? Easy yes, right?  Stabilize prices, everyone wins, right? Except - remember, all these  companies are leveraged like crazy and at these prices if they can't  produce fast enough, they get repoed. So they have to keep selling oil  or they die.\n\nTLDR - Trump needs this deal so the market doesn't go tits up and he can  get re-elected. If we do the deal, capitalism takes another hit and  small oil producers get \\*\\*\\*\\*ed.\n\nUps/Downs: These fucks never find a way to deal and they don't want to. Oil goes to 15 and the shale patch goes tits up. Banks repo. Market crashes. Look, I know we are obsessed with the coronas. BUT - I think oil is where the real battle is. When US oil goes under. And it will. That's what takes the rest of the house of cards with it.\n\nEnergy has already taken it on the chin, so it's a risky short - but bankruptcies are looming in the smaller players.\n\nEdit: Almost all the other players involved have a state run oil industry, SA, Russia, Mexico, etc. that can mandate and enforce such cuts. In the US, we have private business, and we don't currently have the ability to mandate or enforce cuts - which is why we never cruise these opec meetings for dick. We can't  legally mandate that oil biz cut production. ",
