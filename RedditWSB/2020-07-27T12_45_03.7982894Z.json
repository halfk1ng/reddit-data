update on what happened last week, what's coming this week, and my autist thoughts on how that may play out in the market.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention FOMC thanks u/lethalposter for the reminder! I expect a decent fake pump off this into Thursday because although people are acting like it could be a surprise it really isn’t. Zero interest rates, continued easing seems to be the foregone conclusion but market loves suspense games. \n\n***Quick postmortum of Tendie Stimulus 1***\n\nCongrats to those of who you rode with me on that VXX play--the timing and accuracy worked out so well I'd be lying if I said even I wasn't shocked.  If you went with the 32/34 plays you still saw some profit, but the 30c on 7/24 strike was where it was at.  I updated in the comments on the first post about the switch to 30c on Wednesday and here on my Twitter --sorry if you didn't see it at the time, I'll try to put updates to call/strike on here too at the top this time, not just Twitter (i actually have a real job now, too, unfortunately, that requires me from time to time :()\n\nWe got a big assist from China on the volatility, and in my trading I am trying to remember that mean ol' Mr.China is not going anywhere this week.  If I'm being honest, I think it was a bigger factor last week than even the floundering negotiations.  So, to a certain extent, I can only take so much credit for that call.  Please remember China retaliation is coming if you're still committed to trading both indexes and volatility, and be more conservative in your approach for a bit.\n\nThat said, this week is set up to be another bumpy ride.  Things have been a little confusing, so\n\n*Here's an update on what's happening with negotiations:*\n\nRepublicans, who have not done a thing about the HEROES act until this past week, were busy the past 7 days fighting among *themselves* for the *first* offer to make to Democrats.  Them getting this starting point out on Monday is in no way a victory for the process; this was actually supposed to be done by last Tuesday.  The noteworthy tidbits:\n\n* Donald Trump demanded a payroll tax cut, supported by Mnuchin, early last week (think of this as like a temporary easing measure which allows both individuals and employers to gain an extra 1-3% in their check).  Senate Republicans pushed back, and the WH surprisingly capitulated on the demand.\n* Their next internal squabbles had to do with the Extended UI benefits (I'll get to that in a minute)\n* The big breakthrough this weekend was committing to another round $1,200 Stimulus checks, and an extension on the eviction moratorium (this is HUGE for the housing market)\\*\n\n***So, what's important here?***\n\n* The payroll tax rebuff against the White House orders was important because the GOP knew the Dems wouldn't have it, so they wouldn't add it.  **Senate Republicans already ceding ground on an issue that was key to the President.**  As much as McConnell postures, this would indicate that Republicans understand how sensitive they're re-election chances are to the outcomes here and Momma Pelosi kinda has them by the short and curlys.\n* Repubs came out on Thursday saying two key things: 1) UI extension would fall from $600 to $100 a week in their proposal and 2) they were willing to apply a \"temporary\" extensin of UI benefits as a stopgap measure; with benefits enhancement set to expire this coming week.  PELOSI SAID HELL NO TO THE TEMP EXTENSION.  Again, Dems know they have them cornered.  Republicans this weekend started throwing out raising the weekly to $200, up from $100, and since this is the starting point of negotiations I think the Republicans know they may have to bend over all the way to $350 or $400 weekly, even, and are trying their best to come in low enough to get out with $300.\n\n*\\*Side note: the eviction moratorium is a huge win for Dems, but it's also a win for staving off what was clearly a coming housing crisis.  I believe there is another win wrapped inside this win; at some point down the road, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next month, but sometime in the next year, a mortgage/rent relief program is going to be floated.  They already introduced a city-wide lottery here in Los Angeles where you can have your missed COVID rent paid by the government if you can prove you lost employment due to COVID.  There is just no way they can be expecting all the people who got a free ride to be saving and pay back lump sums of multiple thousands to landlords once this all clears up.  I guarantee there is a nationwide rental credit or something in the future, it's economically unfeasible not to.  The hard part will be figuring out how to not punish the people who scrimped and did things right and used their UI/COVID check to pay rent on time, while rewarding those that didn't*\n\n***So, what will happen  in the coming week***\n\n* People are dancing over the $1,200 stimulus check announcement--and yes, I think it will provide a healthy boost for the morning session tomorrow.  I hope so, at least, given I'm holding a 7/27 323c on SPY and a QQQ 7/31 160c (which I'm actually not terribly happy with myself for buying).  But please remember, that's only a part of what is the beginnings of the new package negotiations.  One thing I will say is that the market actually cares way less about UI than the Stimulus checks--the $1,200 covers the midle class working folks if it's  up to $75,000.  Extended UI is also for survival with a cherry on top, the $1,200 affects retail, travel, tech, etc.  That said, this week will still be volatile\n   * Pelosi is going to say, probably Monday afternoon/evening after Republicans send theri package that it's a no.  Markets will get nervous because they will act like they're surprised by this, and freak out that a deal won't get done in time.  Rhetoric around a no deal will get ratcheted up.\n   * There are still probably at least two full back and forth draft cycles between both sides before we see a deal\n   * China is still going to retaliate\n   * All the tech CEOs are being brought to the hill (moved from Monday to Wednesday).  They are speaking in front of the Democratic house rather than the Republican Senate.  I don't expect it to be kind, particularly in light of recent Bezos hate, Zuckerberg Civil Rights issues, and Papa Elon's recent shenanigans (though he won't be there).\n   * Non-partisan take: Republican or Democrat I think it's pretty clear Pelosi is going to win this one.  a) COVID is getting worse, and the Republican platform largely centered around it being better b) Republicans frittering away off-session time not making any progress is bad optics c) they're already capitulating on key offers d) this is going to THE issue of the coming election--aside from COVID, which Donnie has botched\n\n***How I'm playing it***\n\nHonestly, I'm a fucking QQQ addict, and even I will be staying away until EOW if I can dump these 7/31 calls for a profit Monday morning/early afternoon.  It's just not time yet.  **This week is a week to play invididual equities, not indexes.  If you hit on an index you're not gonna hit THAT big, and if you lose you're going to lose big and be like yeah, I pretty much could see this coming**.  So, if things generally are unfolding as I think;\n\n*Monday*\n\nDumping: my QQQ calls and my SPY 7/27 once/if I see a profit in the morning session. Moving into: GRMN\\* 90p 8/21, CRWD 105 8/21c\\*\\*, SPOT\\*\\*\\* 300c 8/7 or 8/21 depending on how it is PM\n\nEDIT: u/hospitalchurn brought up ZS here too in the comments, which I didn’t know much about. At first glance looking like as strong as a play as CRWD if not even stronger. \n\n*Tuesday*\n\nIf we haven't tanked and VXX has reset to sub 29 VXX: 7/31 29c (dumping likely Thursday)\n\n*Wednesday* Sitting on my hands but that's a god damn lie because I'll probably have found some rididulous YOLO on the daily thread and will move my GRMN put money into it\n\n*Thursday*\n\nDumping VXX, reassessing, and likely putting a bunch into 8/7 and 8/10c's anticipating a done deal and a bounce back from a beating this week.  Will load up on QQQ as well as I think tech hearings will be a bottom of sorts\n\n*Friday*\n\nUpdating this DD on why I did none of this and instead put my bank account and heart into the bank of Su Bae.  But hopefully not lol.  AMD has to come down.  I'll most likely be staying in the SPY and QQQ call game for 8/7\n\n*Notes:*\n\n\\*GRMN is going to get WAY worse; similar situation have seen stocks drop by the 20% to 30% range in the immediate aftermath.  The fact that they are doing TERRIBLY at communicating with their customers is a godsend because it means they have plenty more bad news to trickle out in pieces next week.

I expect a decent fake pump off this into Thursday because although people are acting like it could be a surprise it really isn’t. Zero interest rates, continued easing seems to be the foregone conclusion but market loves suspense games. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick postmortum of Tendie Stimulus 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Congrats to those of who you rode with me on that VXX play--the timing and accuracy worked out so well I&amp;#39;d be lying if I said even I wasn&amp;#39;t shocked.  If you went with the 32/34 plays you still saw some profit, but the 30c on 7/24 strike was where it was at.  I updated in the comments on the first post about the switch to 30c on Wednesday and here on my Twitter --sorry if you didn&amp;#39;t see it at the time, I&amp;#39;ll try to put updates to call/strike on here too at the top this time, not just Twitter (i actually have a real job now, too, unfortunately, that requires me from time to time :()&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got a big assist from China on the volatility, and in my trading I am trying to remember that mean ol&amp;#39; Mr.China is not going anywhere this week.  If I&amp;#39;m being honest, I think it was a bigger factor last week than even the floundering negotiations.  So, to a certain extent, I can only take so much credit for that call.  Please remember China retaliation is coming if you&amp;#39;re still committed to trading both indexes and volatility, and be more conservative in your approach for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, this week is set up to be another bumpy ride.  Things have been a little confusing, so&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an update on what&amp;#39;s happening with negotiations:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Republicans, who have not done a thing about the HEROES act until this past week, were busy the past 7 days fighting among &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; offer to make to Democrats.  Them getting this starting point out on Monday is in no way a victory for the process; this was actually supposed to be done by last Tuesday.  The noteworthy tidbits:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Donald Trump demanded a payroll tax cut, supported by Mnuchin, early last week (think of this as like a temporary easing measure which allows both individuals and employers to gain an extra 1-3% in their check).  Senate Republicans pushed back, and the WH surprisingly capitulated on the demand.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their next internal squabbles had to do with the Extended UI benefits (I&amp;#39;ll get to that in a minute)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The big breakthrough this weekend was committing to another round $1,200 Stimulus checks, and an extension on the eviction moratorium (this is HUGE for the housing market)*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, what&amp;#39;s important here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The payroll tax rebuff against the White House orders was important because the GOP knew the Dems wouldn&amp;#39;t have it, so they wouldn&amp;#39;t add it.  &lt;strong&gt;Senate Republicans already ceding ground on an issue that was key to the President.&lt;/strong&gt;  As much as McConnell postures, this would indicate that Republicans understand how sensitive they&amp;#39;re re-election chances are to the outcomes here and Momma Pelosi kinda has them by the short and curlys.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Repubs came out on Thursday saying two key things: 1) UI extension would fall from $600 to $100 a week in their proposal and 2) they were willing to apply a &amp;quot;temporary&amp;quot; extensin of UI benefits as a stopgap measure; with benefits enhancement set to expire this coming week.  PELOSI SAID HELL NO TO THE TEMP EXTENSION.  Again, Dems know they have them cornered.  Republicans this weekend started throwing out raising the weekly to $200, up from $100, and since this is the starting point of negotiations I think the Republicans know they may have to bend over all the way to $350 or $400 weekly, even, and are trying their best to come in low enough to get out with $300.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\\&lt;/em&gt;Side note: the eviction moratorium is a huge win for Dems, but it&amp;#39;s also a win for staving off what was clearly a coming housing crisis.  I believe there is another win wrapped inside this win; at some point down the road, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next month, but sometime in the next year, a mortgage/rent relief program is going to be floated.  They already introduced a city-wide lottery here in Los Angeles where you can have your missed COVID rent paid by the government if you can prove you lost employment due to COVID.  There is just no way they can be expecting all the people who got a free ride to be saving and pay back lump sums of multiple thousands to landlords once this all clears up.  I guarantee there is a nationwide rental credit or something in the future, it&amp;#39;s economically unfeasible not to.  The hard part will be figuring out how to not punish the people who scrimped and did things right and used their UI/COVID check to pay rent on time, while rewarding those that didn&amp;#39;t*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, what will happen  in the coming week&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;People are dancing over the $1,200 stimulus check announcement--and yes, I think it will provide a healthy boost for the morning session tomorrow.  I hope so, at least, given I&amp;#39;m holding a 7/27 323c on SPY and a QQQ 7/31 160c (which I&amp;#39;m actually not terribly happy with myself for buying).  But please remember, that&amp;#39;s only a part of what is the beginnings of the new package negotiations.  One thing I will say is that the market actually cares way less about UI than the Stimulus checks--the $1,200 covers the midle class working folks if it&amp;#39;s  up to $75,000.  Extended UI is also for survival with a cherry on top, the $1,200 affects retail, travel, tech, etc.  That said, this week will still be volatile\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pelosi is going to say, probably Monday afternoon/evening after Republicans send theri package that it&amp;#39;s a no.  Markets will get nervous because they will act like they&amp;#39;re surprised by this, and freak out that a deal won&amp;#39;t get done in time.  Rhetoric around a no deal will get ratcheted up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are still probably at least two full back and forth draft cycles between both sides before we see a deal&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;China is still going to retaliate&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All the tech CEOs are being brought to the hill (moved from Monday to Wednesday).  They are speaking in front of the Democratic house rather than the Republican Senate.  I don&amp;#39;t expect it to be kind, particularly in light of recent Bezos hate, Zuckerberg Civil Rights issues, and Papa Elon&amp;#39;s recent shenanigans (though he won&amp;#39;t be there).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Non-partisan take: Republican or Democrat I think it&amp;#39;s pretty clear Pelosi is going to win this one.  a) COVID is getting worse, and the Republican platform largely centered around it being better b) Republicans frittering away off-session time not making any progress is bad optics c) they&amp;#39;re already capitulating on key offers d) this is going to THE issue of the coming election--aside from COVID, which Donnie has botched&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How I&amp;#39;m playing it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I&amp;#39;m a fucking QQQ addict, and even I will be staying away until EOW if I can dump these 7/31 calls for a profit Monday morning/early afternoon.  It&amp;#39;s just not time yet.  &lt;strong&gt;This week is a week to play invididual equities, not indexes.  If you hit on an index you&amp;#39;re not gonna hit THAT big, and if you lose you&amp;#39;re going to lose big and be like yeah, I pretty much could see this coming&lt;/strong&gt;.  So, if things generally are unfolding as I think;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dumping: my QQQ calls and my SPY 7/27 once/if I see a profit in the morning session. Moving into: GRMN* 90p 8/21, CRWD 105 8/21c**, SPOT*** 300c 8/7 or 8/21 depending on how it is PM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;a href=\"/u/hospitalchurn\"&gt;u/hospitalchurn&lt;/a&gt; brought up ZS here too in the comments, which I didn’t know much about. At first glance looking like as strong as a play as CRWD if not even stronger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we haven&amp;#39;t tanked and VXX has reset to sub 29 VXX: 7/31 29c (dumping likely Thursday)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday&lt;/em&gt; Sitting on my hands but that&amp;#39;s a god damn lie because I&amp;#39;ll probably have found some rididulous YOLO on the daily thread and will move my GRMN put money into it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dumping VXX, reassessing, and likely putting a bunch into 8/7 and 8/10c&amp;#39;s anticipating a done deal and a bounce back from a beating this week.  Will load up on QQQ as well as I think tech hearings will be a bottom of sorts&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Updating this DD on why I did none of this and instead put my bank account and heart into the bank of Su Bae.  But hopefully not lol.  AMD has to come down.  I&amp;#39;ll most likely be staying in the SPY and QQQ call game for 8/7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*GRMN is going to get WAY worse; similar situation have seen stocks drop by the 20% to 30% range in the immediate aftermath.  The fact that they are doing TERRIBLY at communicating with their customers is a godsend because it means they have plenty more bad news to trickle out in pieces next week.  They were cucked, yes, but as always happens in these situations, their lack of honesty, proactiveness, and trasnparency is going to cuck them way more.  Forward guidance during their earnings call will be poopy, and there was already talk that they were honestly topped out at 100 a share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**CRWD has kind of taken a beating this month, and cloud security is going to be a big winner as the GRMN story breaks more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***Erbody that know whatsup knows SPOT is going to hit 300 sometime soon.

That being said heres my hypothesis.\n\n# $UA Has Struggled\n\nThis is no secret as many of us have brand name recognition of $UA and many of us own it. We know its not Nike and it's a step above Champions and other retail store brands, but it is simply the cost efficient/value brand for people that want quality and but aren't willing to pay Nike prices or get chafed nipples from the $WMT brand. It's become the largest athletic apparel brand in the US, with growth potential in China, signing one of the NBAs biggest star Steph Curry.\n\nHeres the problem, the company is facing increased competition and Covid may of burned down the house when they closed retailers. $UA helped prove there is a middle ground between $NKE and $WMT in quality and price, but they failed to build beyond that, and now $AMZN and other other brands have saturated the market. When i need workout clothes, i look online, a small part of $UA business model. I look for value, and although i'm not buying Nike i'm not buying $UA either. There are tons of other brands that provide the same quality cheaper, and i don't care about brand at they gym, just comfort. $UA failed to build a signature style, they got Steph Curry, but i never hear a 24 year old sneaker head dying over their new pair of shoes.  They failed to push online channels of distribution, \"have you been to their website?\", and some compare their pandemic model to $LULU but they are completely different brands by quality, price and consumer segment.\n\nThe companies lack of success could be bad marketing, they have the largest athletic apparel market share, but they can't turn a decent YOY earnings report. So it comes down to poor financial management and high levels of competition driving lower margins. In 2016 $UA was nearly $50/share and its lost billions YOY. Now it's facing an unpredictable pandemic, and record low revenue on a house of debt.\n\n# Important Factors for ER\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Covid**\n\nThe pandemic closed retailers and one of the largest retailers of $UA is Kohl's ($KSS). Because nearly 80% of the companies worth is in their merchandise revenue, this is a major hit. The other 20% is a licensee program that they get from selling the right to 3rd party manufacturers to make and sell the brand. They get revenue from licenses, but i'm not sure about royalties. This means that wholesale manufacturers could sell to other online retailers at a lower competitive rate than $UA  if they are crafty enough, and their is supposedly low oversight on this. You can buy $UA on $AMZN but that doesn't mean you will be buying directly from $UA, and this could be true in open retail stores now. from 2017 to Q1 2020 online sales on $UA website have only grown 4%. $UA has had a tough time to have a direct to consumer channel over the past two quarters. The pandemic has lead to huge losses in retail sales, and the brands themselves. This leads us to our next subject.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **DEBT DEBT &amp; More DEBT**\n\n$UA Market Cap: $4.837 Billion\n\nLiabilities: $3.387 Billion (Q1 2020)\n\nAssets: $1.550 Billion (Q1 2020)\n\nCash is KING and $UA is in desperate need of it with a recent convertible note offering that raised over $400 million dollars. I'm not a finance expert, but here's a snippet that explains the liquidity crunch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;As of March 31, Under Armour had just $959 million in cash. Now, it recently raised another $460 million or so in a convertible note, so its total liquidity is about $1.41 billion. But if it burns through $400 million over the next two quarters, the balance would fall to $600 million or so.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At that point, the company would likely have to raise permanent equity and/or a mixture of equity and debt. Right now the company’s tangible book value per share (TBVPS) is just $1.02 billion, or $2.26 per share, according to data compiled by *Seeking Alpha*.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So, here is the problem: By the end of Q3, with another $800 million in FCF loses, the tangible book value will fall to $224 million or so, and the TBVPS will be just 49 cents per share. If that’s the case, there is no way that UA stock would still be trading at $9.28 per share, where it was earlier this week.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-InvestorsPlace (Mark Hake)\n\nSimply put they need to be frugal and cut cost to prevent bankruptcy. this is shown further in the last two weeks when $UA announced they will sell their running/social app, MyFitnessPal. They also sought to break a sponsorship deal with UCLA to conserve cash (nearly $20mil/year).\n\nThe price tag for MyFitnessPal in 2015 was $425million, i don't think $UA will have a easy time getting anyone to buy it, much less gain on the investment. Also the sponsorship deal isn't broken, yet, and if they do it may come with a huge monetary penalty....exactly what they want to avoid.\n\nThis weeks earnings report will announce a huge amount of new liabilities along with massive reductions in revenue expectations. **This is the most important part of the ER this week.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **China**\n\nGood news this week for $UA is that they won a branding lawsuit in China this week...against a competitor that you nor I have and will never hear of.\n\nChina is a very interesting component in the American economic and political world. They are a huge market, but politically they are neither our ally nor our foe. India will give us the same problem in 10-15 years. With increased tensions between DC and Beijing the risk of tariffs and  american companies suffering are on the rise, especially retail and manufacturing.\n\nHowever, China presents a huge growth opportunity to whichever lucky retailers and brands can bribe the right officials and not get caught. $UA is one of those lucky companies, but they are competing in a tough sector. Nike, Adidas, New Balance, a zillion new brands that nobody has heard of and of course knock offs. I lived in Shanghai for a year in college, and theirs \"Fake mall\" everywhere selling the new Jorban's and Rolex's and of course $UA and the Chinese government will never stop it because they don't practice fair trade practices, at least correctly.\n\n30% of revenue for $UA is international business including several asian and european countries and Australia.  China could eventually be more of a cash cow than the US for $UA.\n\nThe international opportunity is real, but $UA may never see the light at the end of the tunnel due to this dark period of financial ruins and a competitive marketplace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Upside?**\n\nThe ER for $UA is going to be devastating as it has been in quarters past. you'd be insane to think any differently as the company has only seen worse and worse circumstances with little navigational correction. The only thing that could prevent a total 15-25% downside is some sort of good news. What possible good news could they have, i personally can't think of any if they are being honest and don't give BS projections like $TSLA. IF you think of any, or i'm missing any honest upside to this ER please comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Expectations**\n\nEPS: -0.4$ (Big miss)\n\nRevenue: $536mil (Near miss)\n\nRevenue is key, but the Cash flow and added liabilities will be the dagger.\n\n# A LITTLE TA &amp; CHART PRICE ACTION\n\n[6 month Daily candle](https://preview.redd.it/4mgnhbl5dbd51.png?width=2798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5629161081cd3dffe19e83eb83ee7183d5b67185)\n\nThe price of $UA has been hovering around $6.40 &amp; $10.60 for nearly 5 months. $UA has found a solid support at $8.25 and has an upward channel trend, and this has been a very slow recovery relative to other retail brands.\n\nRSI is inching toward overbought. MACD is unsure of the last two months progression and is looking to swing one way or the other after the ER, my bet is down. i expect that $UA will continue on trend nearing $10.60, if the stock price does not fall below the three day trend line(Lilac) then i will wait until thursday afternoon to buy the Puts for the morning ER Call. IF it falls below the lilac line before thursday afternoon i expect my downward channel to be correct and i purchase puts immediately.\n\nStill pondering my strategy for entry and optimizing the return, between there two option ideas.\n\n*Super BEAR: 7/31 $8.50-$9 Puts*\n\n*Conservative BEAR: 8/14 $7.50-$8 Puts*\n\n$UA has a great value product. It has not done a good job financially due to massive oversight in fiscal management, not creating a better direct to consumer interface, and not being competitive enough in a market with stagnant margins and retail competition that can undercut and or be more popular than the other with celebrities and fashion. $UA is not $LULU, and its drowning in debt with no end in sight. Their model has failed, and their leadership has failed. I suspect retail traders who know $UA by name recognition are propping this up, not understanding their in trouble. As soon as institutional money abandons so will the pocket investors, not to poke fun at you retards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut hey, i may just be a fucking retard.\n\nP.S. - IF $UA goes under, or is bought out, which athletic apparel company gains the most? My guess is $NKE (long) or $AMZN.","author_fullname":"t2_2c76vt4e","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Earning Plays for Dummies: $UA is Under Water (Basic TA &amp; Obvious Catalysts)","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"DD"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/wallstreetbets","hidden":false,"pwls":0,"link_flair_css_class":"dd","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":76,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"media_metadata":{"4mgnhbl5dbd51":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image/png","p":[{"y":58,"x":108,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/4mgnhbl5dbd51.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccfe01a8b412cf588f23d7471427b6d1f90165c9"},{"y":117,"x":216,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/4mgnhbl5dbd51.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59dd689d4dff25a369f46ad1c56f06f2b432f6fc"},{"y":174,"x":320,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/4mgnhbl5dbd51.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f7c3c6fca1ee7a3aaf99744e871875f48524b38"},{"y":348,"x":640,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/4mgnhbl5dbd51.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c4f903a3a1684b2242fc97c4029ba0e1a063b99"},{"y":522,"x":960,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/4mgnhbl5dbd51.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8010dd1614d14442484be0b2fa5b3eead1ae30d2"},{"y":588,"x":1080,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/4mgnhbl5dbd51.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bc8f61fcc632543874eeb25e74be42cb4381bc7"}],"s":{"y":1524,"x":2798,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/4mgnhbl5dbd51.png?width=2798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5629161081cd3dffe19e83eb83ee7183d5b67185"},"id":"4mgnhbl5dbd51"}},"name":"t3_hykg5t","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":0.88,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":29,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":140,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"DD","can_mod_post":false,"score":29,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/uWiWDosU7_MYsbqLMf3CzRFVuH87lMvm1vYfmbCKK_I.jpg","edited":1595821035.0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1595848027.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":0,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.wallstreetbets","allow_live_comments":true,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: $UA is taking on a lot of debt because of historically low retail sales causing near bankruptcy cash flow.

Right now the company’s tangible book value per share (TBVPS) is just $1.02 billion, or $2.26 per share, according to data compiled by &lt;em&gt;Seeking Alpha&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, here is the problem: By the end of Q3, with another $800 million in FCF loses, the tangible book value will fall to $224 million or so, and the TBVPS will be just 49 cents per share. If that’s the case, there is no way that UA stock would still be trading at $9.28 per share, where it was earlier this week.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-InvestorsPlace (Mark Hake)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simply put they need to be frugal and cut cost to prevent bankruptcy. this is shown further in the last two weeks when $UA announced they will sell their running/social app, MyFitnessPal. They also sought to break a sponsorship deal with UCLA to conserve cash (nearly $20mil/year).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The price tag for MyFitnessPal in 2015 was $425million, i don&amp;#39;t think $UA will have a easy time getting anyone to buy it, much less gain on the investment. Also the sponsorship deal isn&amp;#39;t broken, yet, and if they do it may come with a huge monetary penalty....exactly what they want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This weeks earnings report will announce a huge amount of new liabilities along with massive reductions in revenue expectations. &lt;strong&gt;This is the most important part of the ER this week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good news this week for $UA is that they won a branding lawsuit in China this week...against a competitor that you nor I have and will never hear of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;China is a very interesting component in the American economic and political world. They are a huge market, but politically they are neither our ally nor our foe. India will give us the same problem in 10-15 years. With increased tensions between DC and Beijing the risk of tariffs and  american companies suffering are on the rise, especially retail and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, China presents a huge growth opportunity to whichever lucky retailers and brands can bribe the right officials and not get caught. $UA is one of those lucky companies, but they are competing in a tough sector. Nike, Adidas, New Balance, a zillion new brands that nobody has heard of and of course knock offs. I lived in Shanghai for a year in college, and theirs &amp;quot;Fake mall&amp;quot; everywhere selling the new Jorban&amp;#39;s and Rolex&amp;#39;s and of course $UA and the Chinese government will never stop it because they don&amp;#39;t practice fair trade practices, at least correctly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;30% of revenue for $UA is international business including several asian and european countries and Australia.  China could eventually be more of a cash cow than the US for $UA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The international opportunity is real, but $UA may never see the light at the end of the tunnel due to this dark period of financial ruins and a competitive marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upside?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ER for $UA is going to be devastating as it has been in quarters past. you&amp;#39;d be insane to think any differently as the company has only seen worse and worse circumstances with little navigational correction. The only thing that could prevent a total 15-25% downside is some sort of good news. What possible good news could they have, i personally can&amp;#39;t think of any if they are being honest and don&amp;#39;t give BS projections like $TSLA. IF you think of any, or i&amp;#39;m missing any honest upside to this ER please comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EPS: -0.4$ (Big miss)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Revenue: $536mil (Near miss)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Revenue is key, but the Cash flow and added liabilities will be the dagger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;A LITTLE TA &amp;amp; CHART PRICE ACTION&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4mgnhbl5dbd51.png?width=2798&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5629161081cd3dffe19e83eb83ee7183d5b67185\"&gt;6 month Daily candle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The price of $UA has been hovering around $6.40 &amp;amp; $10.60 for nearly 5 months. $UA has found a solid support at $8.25 and has an upward channel trend, and this has been a very slow recovery relative to other retail brands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RSI is inching toward overbought. MACD is unsure of the last two months progression and is looking to swing one way or the other after the ER, my bet is down. i expect that $UA will continue on trend nearing $10.60, if the stock price does not fall below the three day trend line(Lilac) then i will wait until thursday afternoon to buy the Puts for the morning ER Call. IF it falls below the lilac line before thursday afternoon i expect my downward channel to be correct and i purchase puts immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still pondering my strategy for entry and optimizing the return, between there two option ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super BEAR: 7/31 $8.50-$9 Puts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conservative BEAR: 8/14 $7.50-$8 Puts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$UA has a great value product. It has not done a good job financially due to massive oversight in fiscal management, not creating a better direct to consumer interface, and not being competitive enough in a market with stagnant margins and retail competition that can undercut and or be more popular than the other with celebrities and fashion. $UA is not $LULU, and its drowning in debt with no end in sight. Their model has failed, and their leadership has failed. I suspect retail traders who know $UA by name recognition are propping this up, not understanding their in trouble. As soon as institutional money abandons so will the pocket investors, not to poke fun at you retards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But hey, i may just be a fucking retard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. - IF $UA goes under, or is bought out, which athletic apparel company gains the most? My guess is $NKE (long) or $AMZN.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"5692ce02-b860-11e5-b542-0edc7016bbd3","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#365b8c","id":"hykg5t","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Miccodaddy","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":39,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hykg5t/earning_plays_for_dummies_ua_is_under_water_basic/","parent_whitelist_status":"no_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hykg5t/earning_plays_for_dummies_ua_is_under_water_basic/","subreddit_subscribers":1370286,"created_utc":1595819227.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","selftext":"The Trump administration is going to pump.......\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/07/26/trump-invests-moderna-vaccine-candidate-381690\n\nI, like the autist I am, missed the fun when this went down last week.....
