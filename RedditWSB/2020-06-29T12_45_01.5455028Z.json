week, instead of doing my typical DDDD, since I've gotten a bit too busy to do the actual research for them, I’ll instead be starting a series of posts where I summarize the chapters that have so far been released in Ray Dalio’s new free publication, “[The Changing World Order](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order)”, as well as some of my thoughts on it. I’d recommend everyone read this on their own, but it’s fairly long and complicated, so I’ll dumb it down and shorten it if you don’t have the time or literacy level to read this yourself. This book contains Dalio’s most recent thesis, which he’s been working over for the past 18 months, but is definitely starting to become more important ever since the world went on lock down. The inspiration for this thesis comes from when he observed a confluence of certain events occurring.\n\n*I was seeing the confluence of*\n\n*1) high levels of indebtedness and extremely low interest rates, which limits central banks’ powers to stimulate the economy*\n\n*2) large wealth gaps and political divisions within countries, which leads to increased social and political conflicts*\n\n*3) a rising world power (China) challenging the overextended existing world power (the US), which causes external conflict. The most recent analogous time was the period from 1930 to 1945. This was very concerning to me.*\n\nWith this idea, he researched centuries of world history, from an economic, monetary, and geopolitical perspective, and studied how world powers rise and fall. Being one of the most famous investment managers of all time, he had access to policy makers, leading economists, and statisticians to help research and form his thesis on examining the cycles of debt, domestic wealth, and international wealth throughout history. Many of these ideas are related to things I have personally looked into and written about before, and have used this as a source of inspiration to form my own ideas.\n\n**Who Is Ray Dalio?**\n\nRay Dalio is possibly the world’s most important hedge fund manager, as well as one of the world’s wealthiest people, with a net worth of $19B. He is the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Bridgewater Capital, which is the world’s largest hedge fund, and manages the assets of everyone from pensions and endowment funds to government sovereign wealth funds and even **central banks** using global macroeconomic trends as the basis of its investment strategies.\n\n**Chapter One - The Big Picture in a Tiny Nutshell**\n\nThis chapter looks at the three most recent powers that have controlled global finance through control of the reserve currency, the Dutch, British, and Americans, as well as some other important countries, and looks at patterns in how they rise and fall from the world stage.\n\n*Productivity*\n\nOn a big picture, learning and the accumulation of knowledge has been the driving force of improving human productivity over time. However, learning happens slowly over time, and can’t explain the existence of sudden shifts in productivity seen in the modern day. Instead, these are caused by a number of forces, 17 to be exact, which tend to transpire in natural cycles over time, coinciding with the rise and fall of empires. Of these cycles, the most important ones are the debt, credit, wealth gap, and geopolitical cycles.\n\n[Productivity Graph](https://preview.redd.it/3ic8q5b1er751.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95e6453b60637a6dae758f3dca30cf269c8611a1)\n\n[Productivity vs US Equities](https://preview.redd.it/xh8hxuh3er751.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d87315a7249dc6e6f9429b76d556691f795eeb6d)\n\nThese cycles start as a period of reconstruction following some sort of crisis, followed by a period of prosperity. These times of prosperity eventually become overextended as debt bubbles form eventually leading to some collapse. This debt collapse acts as a stress test to the economy, destroying the weak and inefficient parts of the economy, where business models used to make sense in a different time, but are now becoming obsolete. Once the weak has been eliminated, and the economy and debt has been restructured, the economy can then once again reconstruct and prosper once more.\n\n*Shifts in Power*\n\nWithin these productivity cycles, shifts in wealth and power between countries can also occur.\n\n[Estimates of Relative Standings of Empires](https://preview.redd.it/w37e35e5er751.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=643c686f6922a58efe733ce309ce489748b4b58b)\n\nFor most of history, China was the leading power in the world, up until the 1600s. The Dutch, starting in the 1600s, became a rich global empire, before being overtaken by the British in the late 1700s, and the United States in the early 1900s. Here, wealth and power is measured as a combination of education, competitiveness, technology, economic output, world trade, military strength, financial strength, and reserve currency status. All of these factors tend to follow its own trends across empires during their rise and falls.\n\n[Archetypical Rise and Declines of Factors of an Empire](https://preview.redd.it/pyo7mv98er751.png?width=1526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c2c31f3abeccdc58e8e1b0f727772df947664ca)\n\nThe rise of an empire is characterized by a nation being led by strong leadership, education, work ethic, unity, capital allocation, and several other mutually reinforcing factors, sustaining the rise. In all the cases seen in recent history, we see a coordination between economic, political, and military forces during this rise, propelling the strength of the empire. The Dutch created the Dutch East India Company, the British had the British East India Company, the US has the military-industrial complex, and China has Chinese state capitalism.\n\nThe peak of an empire occurs when the successes of the rise sow the seeds of the decline. A classic example of this is the middle income trap, where prosperity leads to a rise in the cost of labor, which makes the nation less competitive compared to other nations. As generations change, the work force slowly loses the people that achieved wealth and success through hard work in challenging environments towards a generation of workers that inherited their wealth from previous generations and no experience in dealing with economic hardship and challenges, leaving them more unprepared for it.\n\nBeing the producer of the world’s reserve currency gives them this “exorbitant privilege” of being able to borrow massive amounts of money, increasing their purchasing power. However, this weakens the nation in the long term, since this naturally leads to over-borrowing to finance domestic over-consumption and maintain the empire’s military force overseas, especially as it’s much more politically popular to do so rather than cutting spending or increasing taxes. Initially, the over-borrowing strengthens the empire and is self-reinforcing, as it increases returns for foreign borrowers of the nation’s debt. However, this also eventually causes a shift of wealth from richer debtor countries to poorer ones, and is the beginning of the end of the reserve currency. This happened with the Dutch in their peak from other European countries, the British from the US and British colonies, especially during the World Wars, and now the US from China today. \n\nThe decline of the empire happens when the excesses from the top are reversed in a vicious cycle, and a competitive power gains relative strength. We see debt becoming very large, central banks no longer being able to stimulate economic growth, and eventually the printing of money leading its eventual devaluation. Large wealth gaps, which naturally builds out during prosperity, leads to political extremism on the left and the right, making it harder for the government to effectively address their issues as politicians are unable to agree on policies and potentially seeing a rise in autocratic governments who are able bypass the political process. As the wealthy begin to fear that wealth is in danger from hostility by politicians towards it, they relocate their capital to safer places and currencies (capital flight). This becomes a self-reinforcing cycle as tax revenues decrease as this happens, leading towards more pressure for governments to increase taxation even more, until they eventually outlaw the outflow of capital from their economies, causing even more panic from the wealthy.\n\nA country’s economic and military position becomes challenged by some rising power, increasing the pressure towards the incumbent power to spend more to maintain their position and defending their interests, leading to more over-borrowing and weakening their long term finances. Eventually, the cost of maintaining their geopolitical position outweighs the cost of maintaining their overextended empire. This was seen with the downfall of the Dutch East India company and the Dutch Empire, and the decolonisation period of the British Empire. For the US, this would be the American overseas bases and global military influence and presence, rather than actual colonies.\n\n[Reserve Currency Transitions](https://preview.redd.it/bw35458ber751.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5094f5e357d84b7b2c689d2ffbbc474e760aafe2)\n\nToday, the US is seeing the signs of the beginning of an empire’s decline and the end of the long term debt cycle, with large debts and classic monetary policy no longer being stimulative to the economy, large wealth inequalities, political polarization, at the same time of rising power, China, challenging the US in capital markets, technology, and trade.\n\nChapter 2 and Chapter 3 will be covered in a future posts.

SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, instead of doing my typical DDDD, since I&amp;#39;ve gotten a bit too busy to do the actual research for them, I’ll instead be starting a series of posts where I summarize the chapters that have so far been released in Ray Dalio’s new free publication, “&lt;a href=\"https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order\"&gt;The Changing World Order&lt;/a&gt;”, as well as some of my thoughts on it. I’d recommend everyone read this on their own, but it’s fairly long and complicated, so I’ll dumb it down and shorten it if you don’t have the time or literacy level to read this yourself. This book contains Dalio’s most recent thesis, which he’s been working over for the past 18 months, but is definitely starting to become more important ever since the world went on lock down. The inspiration for this thesis comes from when he observed a confluence of certain events occurring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was seeing the confluence of&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1) high levels of indebtedness and extremely low interest rates, which limits central banks’ powers to stimulate the economy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2) large wealth gaps and political divisions within countries, which leads to increased social and political conflicts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3) a rising world power (China) challenging the overextended existing world power (the US), which causes external conflict. The most recent analogous time was the period from 1930 to 1945. This was very concerning to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this idea, he researched centuries of world history, from an economic, monetary, and geopolitical perspective, and studied how world powers rise and fall. Being one of the most famous investment managers of all time, he had access to policy makers, leading economists, and statisticians to help research and form his thesis on examining the cycles of debt, domestic wealth, and international wealth throughout history. Many of these ideas are related to things I have personally looked into and written about before, and have used this as a source of inspiration to form my own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is Ray Dalio?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ray Dalio is possibly the world’s most important hedge fund manager, as well as one of the world’s wealthiest people, with a net worth of $19B. He is the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Bridgewater Capital, which is the world’s largest hedge fund, and manages the assets of everyone from pensions and endowment funds to government sovereign wealth funds and even &lt;strong&gt;central banks&lt;/strong&gt; using global macroeconomic trends as the basis of its investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter One - The Big Picture in a Tiny Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This chapter looks at the three most recent powers that have controlled global finance through control of the reserve currency, the Dutch, British, and Americans, as well as some other important countries, and looks at patterns in how they rise and fall from the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Productivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a big picture, learning and the accumulation of knowledge has been the driving force of improving human productivity over time. However, learning happens slowly over time, and can’t explain the existence of sudden shifts in productivity seen in the modern day. Instead, these are caused by a number of forces, 17 to be exact, which tend to transpire in natural cycles over time, coinciding with the rise and fall of empires. Of these cycles, the most important ones are the debt, credit, wealth gap, and geopolitical cycles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3ic8q5b1er751.png?width=1328&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=95e6453b60637a6dae758f3dca30cf269c8611a1\"&gt;Productivity Graph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xh8hxuh3er751.png?width=1376&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d87315a7249dc6e6f9429b76d556691f795eeb6d\"&gt;Productivity vs US Equities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These cycles start as a period of reconstruction following some sort of crisis, followed by a period of prosperity. These times of prosperity eventually become overextended as debt bubbles form eventually leading to some collapse. This debt collapse acts as a stress test to the economy, destroying the weak and inefficient parts of the economy, where business models used to make sense in a different time, but are now becoming obsolete. Once the weak has been eliminated, and the economy and debt has been restructured, the economy can then once again reconstruct and prosper once more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shifts in Power&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within these productivity cycles, shifts in wealth and power between countries can also occur.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/w37e35e5er751.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=643c686f6922a58efe733ce309ce489748b4b58b\"&gt;Estimates of Relative Standings of Empires&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For most of history, China was the leading power in the world, up until the 1600s. The Dutch, starting in the 1600s, became a rich global empire, before being overtaken by the British in the late 1700s, and the United States in the early 1900s. Here, wealth and power is measured as a combination of education, competitiveness, technology, economic output, world trade, military strength, financial strength, and reserve currency status. All of these factors tend to follow its own trends across empires during their rise and falls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pyo7mv98er751.png?width=1526&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8c2c31f3abeccdc58e8e1b0f727772df947664ca\"&gt;Archetypical Rise and Declines of Factors of an Empire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rise of an empire is characterized by a nation being led by strong leadership, education, work ethic, unity, capital allocation, and several other mutually reinforcing factors, sustaining the rise. In all the cases seen in recent history, we see a coordination between economic, political, and military forces during this rise, propelling the strength of the empire. The Dutch created the Dutch East India Company, the British had the British East India Company, the US has the military-industrial complex, and China has Chinese state capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The peak of an empire occurs when the successes of the rise sow the seeds of the decline. A classic example of this is the middle income trap, where prosperity leads to a rise in the cost of labor, which makes the nation less competitive compared to other nations. As generations change, the work force slowly loses the people that achieved wealth and success through hard work in challenging environments towards a generation of workers that inherited their wealth from previous generations and no experience in dealing with economic hardship and challenges, leaving them more unprepared for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being the producer of the world’s reserve currency gives them this “exorbitant privilege” of being able to borrow massive amounts of money, increasing their purchasing power. However, this weakens the nation in the long term, since this naturally leads to over-borrowing to finance domestic over-consumption and maintain the empire’s military force overseas, especially as it’s much more politically popular to do so rather than cutting spending or increasing taxes. Initially, the over-borrowing strengthens the empire and is self-reinforcing, as it increases returns for foreign borrowers of the nation’s debt. However, this also eventually causes a shift of wealth from richer debtor countries to poorer ones, and is the beginning of the end of the reserve currency. This happened with the Dutch in their peak from other European countries, the British from the US and British colonies, especially during the World Wars, and now the US from China today. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The decline of the empire happens when the excesses from the top are reversed in a vicious cycle, and a competitive power gains relative strength. We see debt becoming very large, central banks no longer being able to stimulate economic growth, and eventually the printing of money leading its eventual devaluation. Large wealth gaps, which naturally builds out during prosperity, leads to political extremism on the left and the right, making it harder for the government to effectively address their issues as politicians are unable to agree on policies and potentially seeing a rise in autocratic governments who are able bypass the political process. As the wealthy begin to fear that wealth is in danger from hostility by politicians towards it, they relocate their capital to safer places and currencies (capital flight). This becomes a self-reinforcing cycle as tax revenues decrease as this happens, leading towards more pressure for governments to increase taxation even more, until they eventually outlaw the outflow of capital from their economies, causing even more panic from the wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A country’s economic and military position becomes challenged by some rising power, increasing the pressure towards the incumbent power to spend more to maintain their position and defending their interests, leading to more over-borrowing and weakening their long term finances. Eventually, the cost of maintaining their geopolitical position outweighs the cost of maintaining their overextended empire. This was seen with the downfall of the Dutch East India company and the Dutch Empire, and the decolonisation period of the British Empire.

Why is  this relevant? Most index funds already own S&amp;P 400 names, and  joining the S&amp;P 500 is a simple matter of transferring shares  internally.  But it's very rare for a company to not be part of the  S&amp;P 400 when it joins the S&amp;P 500.  In this special case funds  bench marked to the S&amp;P 500 will have to buy tens of millions of  TSLA shares from the open market and hold the shares - reducing the  float significantly.\n\nSo TSLA  \"jumping\" on the S&amp;P 500 without the interim step of the S&amp;P 400  creates huge buying pressure that is underappreciated by the market.   TSLA will join the S&amp;P 500 if it posts a marginal profit in Q2, but  this is highly uncertain, so funds cannot buy in advance.\n\nCan  funds buy options instead? This arbitrage opportunity is closing as  well, because options premiums past the Q2 earnings report are already  over $100 for near the money options, higher than 10% of the underlying.   For example September $950 call options are currently trading at  around $125, which represents a 13% premium. Any fund buying such  options risks losing that hefty 13% price on a speculative bet to  front-run TSLA S&amp;P 500 inclusion.\n\nOf  the global \\~10 trillion dollars of investment assets bench-marked to  the S&amp;P 500, about 0.6% or \\~$60b would have to purchase TSLA on  inclusion, to simply become benchmark-neutral.  I believe only a  fraction have done this so far, which sets up a potentially huge  self-reinforcing event once TSLA's S&amp;P 500 inclusion probability  reaches 100% on Q2 or Q3 profitability.  All the funds that \"missed out\"  will have to scramble to acquire the required shares - and if TSLA  rises rapidly as a resulting buying pressure, the urgency to buy TSLA  will increase in a positive feedback loop.\n\nThe  comparatively still very high short interest in TSLA (12% of the float  compared to \\~2% for similar high-tech firms) might further add rocket  fuel to this phenomenon, in form of short covering.  In particular  long-short funds that are dominantly bench-marked to the S&amp;P 500  will have significant incentives to close their equity short TSLA  positions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'll try to address some of your concerns.\n\nI cannot estimate price rise percentages, and I don't think anyone knows, because share pricing is a 𝒉𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒍𝒚 non-linear phenomenon.\n\nIt all depends on the size of these groups:\n\n* The \"never sell below $5,000\" crowd\n* Insti investors already prepared for S&amp;P 500 inclusion\n* Squeezable equity short anti-shareholders: their covering is anti-dilutive as well\n* Arbitrageurs with call options\n* Momentum\n\nIn the extreme I could imagine a triple digit percentage rise, but that requires a \"Perfect Storm\" scenario with most funds buying into the Tesla FUD and sleeping at the wheel.  Or it could be a dud or sell-the-news event, if institutional TSLA owners plus arbitrageurs outnumber the required \\~40m-60m shares.

Why is  this relevant? Most index funds already own S&amp;amp;P 400 names, and  joining the S&amp;amp;P 500 is a simple matter of transferring shares  internally.  But it&amp;#39;s very rare for a company to not be part of the  S&amp;amp;P 400 when it joins the S&amp;amp;P 500.  In this special case funds  bench marked to the S&amp;amp;P 500 will have to buy tens of millions of  TSLA shares from the open market and hold the shares - reducing the  float significantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So TSLA  &amp;quot;jumping&amp;quot; on the S&amp;amp;P 500 without the interim step of the S&amp;amp;P 400  creates huge buying pressure that is underappreciated by the market.   TSLA will join the S&amp;amp;P 500 if it posts a marginal profit in Q2, but  this is highly uncertain, so funds cannot buy in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can  funds buy options instead? This arbitrage opportunity is closing as  well, because options premiums past the Q2 earnings report are already  over $100 for near the money options, higher than 10% of the underlying.   For example September $950 call options are currently trading at  around $125, which represents a 13% premium. Any fund buying such  options risks losing that hefty 13% price on a speculative bet to  front-run TSLA S&amp;amp;P 500 inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of  the global ~10 trillion dollars of investment assets bench-marked to  the S&amp;amp;P 500, about 0.6% or ~$60b would have to purchase TSLA on  inclusion, to simply become benchmark-neutral.  I believe only a  fraction have done this so far, which sets up a potentially huge  self-reinforcing event once TSLA&amp;#39;s S&amp;amp;P 500 inclusion probability  reaches 100% on Q2 or Q3 profitability.  All the funds that &amp;quot;missed out&amp;quot;  will have to scramble to acquire the required shares - and if TSLA  rises rapidly as a resulting buying pressure, the urgency to buy TSLA  will increase in a positive feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The  comparatively still very high short interest in TSLA (12% of the float  compared to ~2% for similar high-tech firms) might further add rocket  fuel to this phenomenon, in form of short covering.  In particular  long-short funds that are dominantly bench-marked to the S&amp;amp;P 500  will have significant incentives to close their equity short TSLA  positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I&amp;#39;ll try to address some of your concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot estimate price rise percentages, and I don&amp;#39;t think anyone knows, because share pricing is a 𝒉𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒍𝒚 non-linear phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all depends on the size of these groups:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The &amp;quot;never sell below $5,000&amp;quot; crowd&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Insti investors already prepared for S&amp;amp;P 500 inclusion&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Squeezable equity short anti-shareholders: their covering is anti-dilutive as well&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Arbitrageurs with call options&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Momentum&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the extreme I could imagine a triple digit percentage rise, but that requires a &amp;quot;Perfect Storm&amp;quot; scenario with most funds buying into the Tesla FUD and sleeping at the wheel.  Or it could be a dud or sell-the-news event, if institutional TSLA owners plus arbitrageurs outnumber the required ~40m-60m shares.

Nikes earning report were worse than expected by quite a lot actually, a whole 38%. what does that mean? well that people arent spending their cash, theyre saving, youve seen the charts. well, there goes the feds stimulus and unemplyment insurance. On top of that, as we all know, the service sector is as FUK as as my puts placed on march 24th. to reiterate to you illiterate bitch ass cock gobling autists, nobody is dining out, nobody is traveling, and nobody in casinos or hotels. rip bars and clubs.  \n\n\nThis is not all, which type of businesses has this whole thing hurt the most? well none other than your uncles small business. your uncles business is among the many that make up 45% of this economy's GDP.([https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/institute/small-business-economic.htm#:\\~:text=Small%20businesses%20accounted%20for%2045,percent%20in%20the%20late%201990s.&amp;text=48%20percent%20of%20all%20US,percent%20in%20the%20early%202000s.](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/institute/small-business-economic.htm#:~:text=Small%20businesses%20accounted%20for%2045,percent%20in%20the%20late%201990s.&amp;text=48%20percent%20of%20all%20US,percent%20in%20the%20early%202000s.))\n\n Now you inpubesant bull, if even some of the big dogs in businesses are at the brink of bankruptcies, what does that mean for these small businesses? are they going to weather this thing like the likes of apple or microsoft or google? um \\*nervous laughter\\* proboblay not. at least half will close permanently.\n\nSo if 70% of GDP is FUK. the markets right now are in fairyland. straight up rosy sprinkled and evrything.\n\nThere is major uncertainty right now and this will remain for the foreseeable future. Listen, im pretty sure these earning reports are going to be worse than expected, we are half way til we see Q2 numbers for the year and things are looking gloomy. and yet somehow the markets are very close to being at all time highs with a few companies surpassing their ATHs. Tell me, are these companies better off since feb of this year, are the forecasts looking exceptional for growth? um i dont think so you autist peanut.  \n\n\nThere is a major disconnect with the markets and whats going on in the economy. MAJOR. sit back and reflect like the special autist you are. Something is wrong here, very wrong. The fastest 30% drop in history followed by the fastest 46% gain? what kinda bullshit is this? this would make sense if there was a terrorist attack and we've recovered from it, but this whole thing is not over yet as confirmed with the second wave. \n\nThe damage already done is so immense. So immense that the fed nearly doubled it balance sheet in less than a year compared to all of modern history. All of that and this is still not over.. oh no its far from over. the single biggest cases for CV happened 2 DAYS GO. TWO!! IN LATE JUNE! not even september, let alone october and novenmber. rip. sorry guys but in two weeks the CV deaths will begin to rise again. economy is FUK.\n\nMajor Major solvency issue going on here. Can the FED save all these businesses from going bankrupt?? Can the fed keep increasing their balance sheet by a Trilllion dollars every single month till everything returns to normal by august 2021?? That my good sir is at least 12 trillion dollars more. Will the almighty fed increase their their holy balance sheet to 20 trillion dollars?? WILL THEY??? Will the fed convince people to spend despite masses dying!?? Despite all these people \"furloughed\"? Can the fed return the unemplyment rate to less than 8%?????????  \n\n\nIm no financial analyst, but all these indicators are not ingredients for a booming or thriving economy, especially none that should make stock values to exceed ATHs.

On top of that, as we all know, the service sector is as FUK as as my puts placed on march 24th. to reiterate to you illiterate bitch ass cock gobling autists, nobody is dining out, nobody is traveling, and nobody in casinos or hotels. rip bars and clubs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not all, which type of businesses has this whole thing hurt the most? well none other than your uncles small business. your uncles business is among the many that make up 45% of this economy&amp;#39;s GDP.(&lt;a href=\"https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/institute/small-business-economic.htm#:%7E:text=Small%20businesses%20accounted%20for%2045,percent%20in%20the%20late%201990s.&amp;amp;text=48%20percent%20of%20all%20US,percent%20in%20the%20early%202000s.\"&gt;https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/institute/small-business-economic.htm#:~:text=Small%20businesses%20accounted%20for%2045,percent%20in%20the%20late%201990s.&amp;amp;text=48%20percent%20of%20all%20US,percent%20in%20the%20early%202000s.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you inpubesant bull, if even some of the big dogs in businesses are at the brink of bankruptcies, what does that mean for these small businesses? are they going to weather this thing like the likes of apple or microsoft or google? um *nervous laughter* proboblay not. at least half will close permanently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if 70% of GDP is FUK. the markets right now are in fairyland. straight up rosy sprinkled and evrything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is major uncertainty right now and this will remain for the foreseeable future. Listen, im pretty sure these earning reports are going to be worse than expected, we are half way til we see Q2 numbers for the year and things are looking gloomy. and yet somehow the markets are very close to being at all time highs with a few companies surpassing their ATHs. Tell me, are these companies better off since feb of this year, are the forecasts looking exceptional for growth? um i dont think so you autist peanut.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a major disconnect with the markets and whats going on in the economy. MAJOR. sit back and reflect like the special autist you are. Something is wrong here, very wrong. The fastest 30% drop in history followed by the fastest 46% gain? what kinda bullshit is this? this would make sense if there was a terrorist attack and we&amp;#39;ve recovered from it, but this whole thing is not over yet as confirmed with the second wave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The damage already done is so immense. So immense that the fed nearly doubled it balance sheet in less than a year compared to all of modern history. All of that and this is still not over.. oh no its far from over. the single biggest cases for CV happened 2 DAYS GO. TWO!! IN LATE JUNE! not even september, let alone october and novenmber. rip. sorry guys but in two weeks the CV deaths will begin to rise again. economy is FUK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Major Major solvency issue going on here. Can the FED save all these businesses from going bankrupt?? Can the fed keep increasing their balance sheet by a Trilllion dollars every single month till everything returns to normal by august 2021?? That my good sir is at least 12 trillion dollars more. Will the almighty fed increase their their holy balance sheet to 20 trillion dollars?? WILL THEY??? Will the fed convince people to spend despite masses dying!?? Despite all these people &amp;quot;furloughed&amp;quot;? Can the fed return the unemplyment rate to less than 8%?????????  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im no financial analyst, but all these indicators are not ingredients for a booming or thriving economy, especially none that should make stock values to exceed ATHs. I hope im wrong, but its really hard to pretend everythings ok right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON

In total I collected a total of 51 \"ticks\" which is $5100 per 1 lot of the package.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love this trade for a number of reasons.\n\n1. You are short vol and get to collect a decent amount of theta.\n\n* Ie. The trade decays in your favor. and frankly IV is still very high in the S&amp;P.\n* Even if we go up towards my short call spread vol will come in which will be a net positive for my position in most cases regardless of the short deltas from my short call spread\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I view it as a incredibly high expected value to be a winner. really hard to loose when you look at break even points.... Assuming I hold it to expiration which I probably wont but it makes it easier for you amateurs to understand. But my plan is to take it off as it decays and possibly hold a 1 or 2 lot till expiration depending on where the index is trading.\n\n* At expiration to the upside there is no way I can loose money. I collected 51 points for the package and the most my short call spread can be worth at expiration is 50. Thus even if we blow through my short call spread I still make a whopping 1 S&amp;P point ($100 per package I trade).\n* Now to the downside my downside break even at expiration is around 2199. This math is rather simple and that Is at 2199 my long put is worth +801 my short 2750 is worth -551 my short 2500 is worth -301 and I collected +51 in premium.... SO in total that nets out to -1 thus basically my downside break even.\n* Frankly I am not even worried about the downside because I do not mind buying a boatload of the S&amp;P at that price for a long term investor and honestly if we do get down there I could always put on another tree because vol would be lunar expanding my break even dramatically. But this is more of a portfolio trade I put on knowing I would happy to get long at those levels. that is the major caveat to this trade\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) It wins big where I think fair value is. around 2750-2650.\n\n* This trade makes the maximum at expiration if we expire anywhere between 2750/2500. I would make  the maximum of 301 S&amp;P points per package I put on which is $30,100. So with my 5 contracts $150,500\n* Again I would be hard pressed to make that much because I will probably take it off as it decays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) The only way I would net loose is S&amp;P under 2200 and at that point BTFD.

Everyone is talking about tech stocks like FSLY, DDOG, DOCU, or OKTA but I don't see enough posts about LVGO.  Why is Livongo set to rally for what I believe deserves to be a triple digit stock by the end of next year?\n\nWarning: An extensive read but well worth it.\n\n================================================\n\nu/ceud DD 5 months ago:\n\n**Livongo Health (**[$LVGO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=lvgo&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)**)**\n\n* A consumer digital health company with a vision to empower people with chronic conditions to live better through the combined power of technology, real-time personalized information, and support from their chosen care team.\n* The platform analyzes data to build a picture of a person’s patterns, while dietitians and physiologists give them real-time advice about diet, medication and exercise by apps or text message. If a patient’s blood sugar is dangerously low or high, a coach will call to warn them within 60 seconds. Inspired by how big tech companies personalize services and nudge people into certain behaviors, Livongo — short for living-on-the-go — started by treating diabetes, before moving on to hypertension, weight loss and mental health.\n* It also just signed its [largest contract ever](https://www.businessinsider.com/livongo-lands-biggest-contract-yet-2019-10) for the US government, allowing it to provide its diabetes solution to 5.3M employees as part of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Platform starting in 2020. Launching at the start of 2020, the tool will be available to 5 million federal employees and their families — and Livongo is optimistic that the partnership will afford it 45,000 new members and a revenue boost of up to $60 million through 2021. That's a significant lift given that Livongo brought in a total of [$68 million](https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18262001.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE2MzkyMjUvMDAwMTE5MzEyNTE5MTg1MTU5L2Q3MzEyNDlkczEuaHRt/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB050eba75) in revenue in 2018, it reported in its S-1 filing.\n* LVGO's clients include 20% of the Fortune 500 (Target, Pepsi, Microsoft, Merck, and Citigroup) and boast a high retention rate of \\~96%. They reported a 121% YoY growth in Q3 2019 and continue to grow exponentially.\n\nHere are excerpts I've taken from a recent video by Unrivaled Investing I found regarding LVGO:\n\nSource: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrYSCvjXICU&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrYSCvjXICU&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\n**What are they trying to solve?**\n\nOur Health care system currently is only designed for acute and emergent care and is not equipped to provide daily continuous feedback and guidance for patients. This leaves people with ineffective and non adherent care leading to less healthy outcomes that leads to more expenses for both the patient and insurance companies.\n\n**Adressable population:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvimdd80bq751.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c99cf022695fc0ad2fc08adcb6f50c6a07976854\n\n================================================\n\n**People use Livongo because:**\n\n1. Livongo makes it easier for patients to monitor their members to manage their health and their supply logistics.\n2. They provide critical health \"nudges\" that are guardrails to prevent members from getting ill.\n3. Theres a community of health members available 24/7 to assist patients\n\n\"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of care\"\n\nA health nudge or a phone call can help a member who is diabetic who is trending towards hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia to avoid an expensive visit to the ER.\n\n**What Livongo offers employers:**\n\n1. Healthier and happier employees\n2. Lower health care costs for employees (over $1.9k in savings - 3x ROI in 3 Years)\n3. Healthier and happier employee means less sick time and Lower employee churn\n\n\\*This situation is a win-win-win for all sides = employers save money = employees save money and are healthier = Livongo grows In sales = company value increases and expands = happy stock holders\n\n\\*Client retention rate of 95%\n\n\\*Revenue growth of &gt;110% in the past year\n\n\\*member growth rate increasing by the thousands in the past two years with last quarter being 100%\n\n**Expanding the moat:**  (all resources in one company for different health issues)\n\n1. Differentiated competitive offering\n2. One trusted counter party\n3. Cross selling = an even BIGGER addressable market the just diabetes and hypertension\n\nWhy this company is HOT:\n\n1. Offering a whole person perspective is a smart strategy\n2. They're building a proprietary health database with valuable insights that make it harder for new players to enter\n3. Livongo is building a strong value proposition and likely has years of strong revenue growth ahead of them\n\n================================================\n\nA Redditor's (u/friendless2) experience with LVGO I found 3 years ago from r/diabetes:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/5fxhzu/experience\\_with\\_livongo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/5fxhzu/experience_with_livongo/)\n\nMy job has offered to pay for the monthly fee. Since it comes with **unlimited strips and lancets, it is saving me some of the costs of running a meter, and I can check anytime I feel like it instead of trying to limit myself to 5-6 times a day....**\n\nThe nice part about the Livongo, is **I don't waste strips when my backpack gets squished and the Accu-Check spits out a strip without my knowing..**.\n\nThere are limits that you can set, where if you are **below that limit then a nurse coach texts you on your registered phone.** They are nice, and are **willing to answer questions on diabetes (17 years experience answered them by now) or on the meter or web site (computer guy here, I can figure it out). I happen to have hit 38 twice this week, and both times I got pinged immediately. When I was at 48 the meter asked me if I want a coach to contact me. I said no....**\n\n**The website is where you can get graphs and reports. The meter has the same data, but not the averages. You can export the data or print it for your Endo appointments.** You can also **email reports directly to them. You can also have others notified if you are low or high via SMS**.\n\nIt is saving me **$1300 a year** so I am keeping it.\"\n\n================================================\n\n**Catalyst to buy now**:\n\n[https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CMS: Upcoming Medicare payment rule to include permanent telehealth expansions**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Patients initially used virtual care as a necessity during the pandemic but are now demanding it for convenience.**\n\n**\"The patient trust barrier has been broken. There is no going back,\" said Brady, who serves as chief of staff to the deputy secretary and senior adviser to HHS Secretary Alex Azar. \"Telehealth is now the preferred method. People want this as the first site of care. We are seeing a demand from consumers.\"**\n\n**The surge in telehealth coincides with HHS' data-sharing regulations published in February that will give patients easier access to their medical records.**\n\n**\"It will be interesting to see how all this overlaps with interoperability,\" Brady said. \"When patients have access to data and you give them remote virtual care we will see how that combination will help people make better decisions to live healthier lives.\"**\n\n\\----------------\n\n[https://www.staffing.com/what-role-will-telemedicine-play-in-health-care-after-covid-19/](https://www.staffing.com/what-role-will-telemedicine-play-in-health-care-after-covid-19/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What Role Will Telemedicine Play in Health Care After COVID-19?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Dr. Jonathan Wright**\n\n\"I think the vast majority of patients that we have worked with greatly appreciate it and prefer it. For a lot of people, especially if you're working, I take care of a lot of older patients that are retired, but for a working patient, you can just carve out 15 minutes to hop on your computer and do your visit. You don't have to drive into the doctor's office, you don't have to pay for parking and then wait in line to get in, or wait in the exam room. Then the doctor's running late and all those kinds of things. It's just, \"Hey, I just do my quick appointment and get it done and move on.\"\n\nThe other thing that has been wonderful is that, you know obviously, you can have more than one person on a telemedicine call, on a Zoom call, or a Team's call. So the patients' families, no matter where they are in the country, can join on the call as well. For someone that does cancer, and we're talking about different treatment options, it’s so fantastic to be able to see the patient and then their three children in different spots on the call to participate. Then, we don't have the “lost in translation” when the patient passes it on to their family, and everyone can as a group be more on board and help that person with the decision process.\n\n================================================\n\n**Excerpts from Livongo Health Inc (LVGO) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript:** [**https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth**](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth)\n\n**\"** We entered 2020 with significant momentum...we believe remote monitoring is **rapidly becoming the new standard in health and care.** Livongo's connected technology allows our members to track vital signs of interest in maintaining health. We expect that the **ability for both personalized care, as well as broad population surveillance will become critical going forward as an early warning and monitoring system for the healthcare system at large and a way to efficiently deliver care to those who need it most exactly when and where they need it**.\"\n\n\"this pandemic has **accelerated a more extensive virtual care delivery model**. Remote monitoring is here to stay, and we expect it to become the standard of care for the most vulnerable and expensive populations...Livongo is **key to keeping their people healthy, while also saving money. And Livongo is unique in that we have detailed studies to prove that Livongo improves care, saves money, and provides a great member experience**.\"\n\n\"Livongo has a **significant opportunity to continue growing our member base**. Because of our virtuous business model, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has **only reinforced the value of the service we provide our members and clients.** In the first quarter, we added a record 380 new clients, which takes us to 1,252 overall clients, which is up **approximately 44% quarter over quarter.** Member enrollment was ahead of expectations with over 328,000 Livongo for Diabetes members as of the end of the quarter.\"\n\n\"More importantly, we're being asked to **accelerate launches to deliver services to clients who wanted their most vulnerable populations protected sooner and taken steps to position Livongo well pass COVID-19**...This trend was already under way before COVID-19, but the **pandemic accelerates it. We expect that larger, multiproduct, well-capitalized organizations will have an increased advantage**. In March, we announced the Health Transformation Alliance, or HTA, and Welltok.\"\n\n\"Today, **Livongo is even more strongly positioned.** Increasingly, everyone is realizing that our remote monitoring solutions and our focus on the most critical, vulnerable populations are necessary to **support our members through this pandemic in the near term and longer term as the market continues to shift to a virtual care model.\"**\n\n================================================\n\nPrice target raised from $52 to $85\n\n[https://www.tickerreport.com/banking-finance/5818984/livongo-health-nasdaqlvgo-pt-raised-to-85-00-at-keycorp.html](https://www.tickerreport.com/banking-finance/5818984/livongo-health-nasdaqlvgo-pt-raised-to-85-00-at-keycorp.html)\n\n================================================\n\nMy opinion:\n\nI'm in the medical field and my family line currently has 15 doctors. From my perspective, our society is transitioning everything into the digital realm including medicine. Medicine is expanding to place more emphasis on home health, individualized medicine, and preventative care. The most important aspect of medicine is prevention. This is really great for Livongo since their target population comprises the vast majority of Americans and they're expanding internationally as well. In addition, they will be able to save insurance companies thousands of dollars in medical bills. The fact that we're incorporating Cloud + Medicine is just really hard to deny that this is the stepping stone for the future our health care in general. Teladoc utilizes the concept of remote care as well and their growth has been exponential besides the fact that they're not profitable yet just like Livongo. (Livongo said they will begin to be highly profitable by 2021). My family members use Telahealth every day and it is incredible how we're able to provide our medical expertise remotely. This makes it convenient for both healthcare providers and patients. I am slowing adding on to my position, right now I only currently own calls. The current stock price is $74 and I recommend looking deep into this company if it interests you as it did for me. I only see this company growing exponentially with their stock reaching triple digits by the end of next year.\n\n\\*\\*\\*UPDATE:\n\nTo put into perspective of where they stand right now, they currently have 328,000 members (increased new member count by 100% in last quarter as mentioned earlier). The total amount of people with diabetes in the US is 35 million people with +500k new cases per year. They only tapped into 1% of people so FAR. They also have the addressable market of people with hypertension (108 million) and behavior health (46.6 million). So yes, **growth is only going to be exponential f**rom here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: **Livongo Health (**[$LVGO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=lvgo&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)**)**  A consumer digital health company with a vision to empower people with chronic conditions to live better through the combined power of technology, real-time personalized information, and support from their chosen care team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy position currently: 12 $85 C 8/21","author_fullname":"t2_3kvm84ge","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"\"Livongo is the Amazon of Healthcare\" DD","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"DD"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/wallstreetbets","hidden":false,"pwls":0,"link_flair_css_class":"dd","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":92,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"media_metadata":{"kvimdd80bq751":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image/png","p":[{"y":71,"x":108,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/kvimdd80bq751.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f3321c335bbe1589c4cb1633900df25a870609b"},{"y":142,"x":216,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/kvimdd80bq751.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aedbc6a88c1981fb8bdfdcb8894411110d59f86"},{"y":211,"x":320,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/kvimdd80bq751.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9242d47c029c63ccc400a7182e9aee1696fabffc"},{"y":422,"x":640,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/kvimdd80bq751.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e867a0d67d7370fd942419b27326b3988b835dbd"},{"y":634,"x":960,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/kvimdd80bq751.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a25451b7fe2c2c4604ae155cc89a41c3eca1fcc"},{"y":713,"x":1080,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/kvimdd80bq751.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a7704c080602b96de4eeaef0ed9bbf79beb0d77"}],"s":{"y":926,"x":1402,"u":"https://preview.redd.it/kvimdd80bq751.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c99cf022695fc0ad2fc08adcb6f50c6a07976854"},"id":"kvimdd80bq751"}},"name":"t3_hhp7ou","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":0.88,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":82,"total_awards_received":1,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":140,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"DD","can_mod_post":false,"score":82,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/VlvfYFnkN2DuWXhaKKG-X2YuvxoZJHwpZoK1MoKc5Lg.jpg","edited":1593412377.0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{"gid_1":1},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1593417086.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":0,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.wallstreetbets","allow_live_comments":true,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Autists,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bring to you a sleeper play that has been flying under the radar lately going from a stock in the $20s to a high of $79 last week. Everyone is talking about tech stocks like FSLY, DDOG, DOCU, or OKTA but I don&amp;#39;t see enough posts about LVGO.

If a patient’s blood sugar is dangerously low or high, a coach will call to warn them within 60 seconds. Inspired by how big tech companies personalize services and nudge people into certain behaviors, Livongo — short for living-on-the-go — started by treating diabetes, before moving on to hypertension, weight loss and mental health.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It also just signed its &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/livongo-lands-biggest-contract-yet-2019-10\"&gt;largest contract ever&lt;/a&gt; for the US government, allowing it to provide its diabetes solution to 5.3M employees as part of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Platform starting in 2020. Launching at the start of 2020, the tool will be available to 5 million federal employees and their families — and Livongo is optimistic that the partnership will afford it 45,000 new members and a revenue boost of up to $60 million through 2021. That&amp;#39;s a significant lift given that Livongo brought in a total of &lt;a href=\"https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18262001.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE2MzkyMjUvMDAwMTE5MzEyNTE5MTg1MTU5L2Q3MzEyNDlkczEuaHRt/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB050eba75\"&gt;$68 million&lt;/a&gt; in revenue in 2018, it reported in its S-1 filing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;LVGO&amp;#39;s clients include 20% of the Fortune 500 (Target, Pepsi, Microsoft, Merck, and Citigroup) and boast a high retention rate of ~96%.

This leaves people with ineffective and non adherent care leading to less healthy outcomes that leads to more expenses for both the patient and insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adressable population:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kvimdd80bq751.png?width=1402&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c99cf022695fc0ad2fc08adcb6f50c6a07976854\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/kvimdd80bq751.png?width=1402&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c99cf022695fc0ad2fc08adcb6f50c6a07976854&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People use Livongo because:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Livongo makes it easier for patients to monitor their members to manage their health and their supply logistics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They provide critical health &amp;quot;nudges&amp;quot; that are guardrails to prevent members from getting ill.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Theres a community of health members available 24/7 to assist patients&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of care&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A health nudge or a phone call can help a member who is diabetic who is trending towards hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia to avoid an expensive visit to the ER.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Livongo offers employers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Healthier and happier employees&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lower health care costs for employees (over $1.9k in savings - 3x ROI in 3 Years)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Healthier and happier employee means less sick time and Lower employee churn&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*This situation is a win-win-win for all sides = employers save money = employees save money and are healthier = Livongo grows In sales = company value increases and expands = happy stock holders&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Client retention rate of 95%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Revenue growth of &amp;gt;110% in the past year&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*member growth rate increasing by the thousands in the past two years with last quarter being 100%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding the moat:&lt;/strong&gt;  (all resources in one company for different health issues)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Differentiated competitive offering&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One trusted counter party&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cross selling = an even BIGGER addressable market the just diabetes and hypertension&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why this company is HOT:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Offering a whole person perspective is a smart strategy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They&amp;#39;re building a proprietary health database with valuable insights that make it harder for new players to enter&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Livongo is building a strong value proposition and likely has years of strong revenue growth ahead of them&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Redditor&amp;#39;s (&lt;a href=\"/u/friendless2\"&gt;u/friendless2&lt;/a&gt;) experience with LVGO I found 3 years ago from &lt;a href=\"/r/diabetes\"&gt;r/diabetes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/5fxhzu/experience_with_livongo/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/5fxhzu/experience_with_livongo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My job has offered to pay for the monthly fee. Since it comes with &lt;strong&gt;unlimited strips and lancets, it is saving me some of the costs of running a meter, and I can check anytime I feel like it instead of trying to limit myself to 5-6 times a day....&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The nice part about the Livongo, is &lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;#39;t waste strips when my backpack gets squished and the Accu-Check spits out a strip without my knowing..&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are limits that you can set, where if you are &lt;strong&gt;below that limit then a nurse coach texts you on your registered phone.&lt;/strong&gt; They are nice, and are &lt;strong&gt;willing to answer questions on diabetes (17 years experience answered them by now) or on the meter or web site (computer guy here, I can figure it out). I happen to have hit 38 twice this week, and both times I got pinged immediately. When I was at 48 the meter asked me if I want a coach to contact me. I said no....&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The website is where you can get graphs and reports. The meter has the same data, but not the averages. You can export the data or print it for your Endo appointments.&lt;/strong&gt; You can also &lt;strong&gt;email reports directly to them. You can also have others notified if you are low or high via SMS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is saving me &lt;strong&gt;$1300 a year&lt;/strong&gt; so I am keeping it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalyst to buy now&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth\"&gt;https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CMS: Upcoming Medicare payment rule to include permanent telehealth expansions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patients initially used virtual care as a necessity during the pandemic but are now demanding it for convenience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The patient trust barrier has been broken. There is no going back,&amp;quot; said Brady, who serves as chief of staff to the deputy secretary and senior adviser to HHS Secretary Alex Azar. &amp;quot;Telehealth is now the preferred method. People want this as the first site of care. We are seeing a demand from consumers.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The surge in telehealth coincides with HHS&amp;#39; data-sharing regulations published in February that will give patients easier access to their medical records.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;It will be interesting to see how all this overlaps with interoperability,&amp;quot; Brady said. &amp;quot;When patients have access to data and you give them remote virtual care we will see how that combination will help people make better decisions to live healthier lives.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;----------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.staffing.com/what-role-will-telemedicine-play-in-health-care-after-covid-19/\"&gt;https://www.staffing.com/what-role-will-telemedicine-play-in-health-care-after-covid-19/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Role Will Telemedicine Play in Health Care After COVID-19?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Jonathan Wright&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think the vast majority of patients that we have worked with greatly appreciate it and prefer it. For a lot of people, especially if you&amp;#39;re working, I take care of a lot of older patients that are retired, but for a working patient, you can just carve out 15 minutes to hop on your computer and do your visit. You don&amp;#39;t have to drive into the doctor&amp;#39;s office, you don&amp;#39;t have to pay for parking and then wait in line to get in, or wait in the exam room. Then the doctor&amp;#39;s running late and all those kinds of things. It&amp;#39;s just, &amp;quot;Hey, I just do my quick appointment and get it done and move on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other thing that has been wonderful is that, you know obviously, you can have more than one person on a telemedicine call, on a Zoom call, or a Team&amp;#39;s call.

Teladoc utilizes the concept of remote care as well and their growth has been exponential besides the fact that they&amp;#39;re not profitable yet just like Livongo. (Livongo said they will begin to be highly profitable by 2021). My family members use Telahealth every day and it is incredible how we&amp;#39;re able to provide our medical expertise remotely. This makes it convenient for both healthcare providers and patients. I am slowing adding on to my position, right now I only currently own calls. The current stock price is $74 and I recommend looking deep into this company if it interests you as it did for me. I only see this company growing exponentially with their stock reaching triple digits by the end of next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To put into perspective of where they stand right now, they currently have 328,000 members (increased new member count by 100% in last quarter as mentioned earlier). The total amount of people with diabetes in the US is 35 million people with +500k new cases per year. They only tapped into 1% of people so FAR. They also have the addressable market of people with hypertension (108 million) and behavior health (46.6 million). So yes, &lt;strong&gt;growth is only going to be exponential f&lt;/strong&gt;rom here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;strong&gt;Livongo Health (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=lvgo&amp;amp;ty=c&amp;amp;ta=1&amp;amp;p=d\"&gt;$LVGO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;  A consumer digital health company with a vision to empower people with chronic conditions to live better through the combined power of technology, real-time personalized information, and support from their chosen care team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My position currently: 12 $85 C 8/21&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[{"giver_coin_reward":null,"subreddit_id":null,"is_new":false,"days_of_drip_extension":0,"coin_price":100,"id":"gid_1","penny_donate":null,"award_sub_type":"GLOBAL","coin_reward":0,"icon_url":"https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png","days_of_premium":0,"resized_icons":[{"url":"https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png","width":16,"height":16},{"url":"https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png","width":32,"height":32},{"url":"https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png","width":48,"height":48},{"url":"https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png","width":64,"height":64},{"url":"https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png","width":128,"height":128}],"icon_width":512,"static_icon_width":512,"start_date":null,"is_enabled":true,"description":"Shows the Silver Award... and that's it.","end_date":null,"subreddit_coin_reward":0,"count":1,"static_icon_height":512,"name":"Silver","resized_static_icons":[{"url":"https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png","width":16,"height":16},{"url":"https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png","width":32,"height":32},{"url":"https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png","width":48,"height":48},{"url":"https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png","width":64,"height":64},{"url":"https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png","width":128,"height":128}],"icon_format":null,"icon_height":512,"penny_price":null,"award_type":"global","static_icon_url":"https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png"}],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"5692ce02-b860-11e5-b542-0edc7016bbd3","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2th52","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#365b8c","id":"hhp7ou","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"jdogtor","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":101,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"no_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhp7ou/livongo_is_the_amazon_of_healthcare_dd/","parent_whitelist_status":"no_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhp7ou/livongo_is_the_amazon_of_healthcare_dd/","subreddit_subscribers":1307230,"created_utc":1593388286.0,"num_crossposts":1,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"wallstreetbets","selftext":"","author_fullname":"t2_5xg02t0o","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Cramer’s 21 year history of buying days before July 4th -
