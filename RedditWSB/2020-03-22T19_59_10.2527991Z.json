Extensive FEMA training in disaster response\n3. I’ve had a hand in managing over 15 natural and man made disasters (think hurricanes, tornados, Ebola outbreak)\n\nFEMA FOR DUMMIES:\n\n\tAnyone who has been watching the news has seen that Trump has been talking with FEMA on how to help stop the spread of Corona Virus. Most of FEMA’s fame comes from their natural disaster response (or lack thereof). One of FEMA’s greatest abilities is planning, and when I say they plan for everything I mean EVERYTHING. The key to disaster response is to have a plan BEFORE disaster happens. These emergency response plans are written down, reviewed, and tested over and over. Emergency managers do this because they know that when shit hits the fan people panic and if there is already a plan for when shit starts going sideways then its easier to calm down and overcome the problem. Besides FEMA and the FAA the Federal government is very inefficient and about as fast as old people fuckin. After 9/11 FEMA really kicked their ass into high gear and designed a management system that can be scaled to any size and type event, I personally know a local emergency manager who used this system to plan and coordinate his daughters wedding, the same system that helps local, state, and federal governments respond to disaster such as super storm Sandy and hurricane Katrina, its that’s flexible and efficient. These systems are called the [Incident Command System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Command_System) and [National Incident Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Incident_Management_System) and are used to respond to any disaster anywhere at anytime. Fun fact: some of you might already know this but [the IRS even has a plan for collecting taxes after a nuclear war.](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/yes-the-irs-has-an-emergency-apocalypse-plan-to-collect-taxes/)\n\n\tNow everyone thinks that trump is in charge and he’s the one running this show, and on paper he is. However William Brockmann Long is really the HMFIC running this show. Billy is the one who is fundamentally in charge of making sure the United States has a plan to respond to any type of disaster. Trump might be the one saying “I’m doing X about Y” but really its FEMA who is calling the shots and advising the president, Trump is just pulling the trigger. So no matter how much of a babbling ape headed buffoon you think trump is its doesn’t matter because there is a whole team of level headed people behind him who’s one and only job is to manage emergencies.\n\nHOW THIS RELATES TO THE ECONOMY:\n\n\t\tRemember when I said FEMA is efficient as Fuck? Well most companies on the SPX are big enough to understand that large scale disasters have the ability to extremely fuck up their business. That’s why most large corporations have emergency disaster plans, much like FEMA’s, written down in advance incase anything happens. Walmart has an entire [Emergency Operations Center](https://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/hazards/upload/Walmart-Resliency_052316_v2.pdf) that runs 25/8 and its main job is to be on the look out and respond to emergencies that directly impact their company. Most major companies have departments like this model after NIMS and ICS. Here are some examples: [Disney emergency manager job posting](https://jobs.livecareer.com/l/crisis-management-planning-program-manager-disney-cac507473de325204963b6fc39139e51), [PPT presentation on Boeing’s emergency management system](https://ndiastorage.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ndia/2009/DIBCIP/Komendat.pdf), and [Amazon job posting for Emergency Management Director ](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/pm-emergency-response-and-business-continuity-at-amazon-1509562192)\n\n\tSo while investors might not have “priced in” the effects of this global disaster I can guarantee you almost every company on the SPX did, and they have a plan to overcome it. We already are seeing news articles about car companies repurposing their factories to make ventilators and cruise companies offering their ships to help house patients. While the general public might not have had a plan for a fast sweeping indiscriminate plague sized case of beer aids, I am willing to bet my entire life savings (&lt;$50,000) on the fact that every major company out there has a binder on a shelf somewhere with a section in it detailing how the company should respond to a pandemic in order to mitigate any negative effects.\n\n\tSo while the investors might not have priced in the beer aids and stock fell like a fat bitch during an earthquake, most companies are well ahead of the curve. Majority of you will hate to hear this, but were close to the bottom. Give it one month and everything will be very close to being back to normal. Sure GDP might fall and a few smaller companies that weren’t prepared for a disaster will go under but in one months time there will be no reason for stock prices to continue to be falling.\n\nTL;DR: FEMA, DIS, WMT, et al. have priced in beer aids. Stonks only go up until they don’t, and the IRS will still taxes those gains after a nuke.\n\nPOS: SPY 3/23 $231/$232c, UUP 3/27 $28c DAL 4/17 $35c, CCL 4/17 $42.5c, F 6/19 $4p, TAK 7/17 $22.5c, GM 1/21 $47c",

These systems are called the [Incident Command System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Command_System) and [National Incident Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Incident_Management_System) and are used to respond to any disaster anywhere at anytime. Fun fact: some of you might already know this but [the IRS even has a plan for collecting taxes after a nuclear war.](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/yes-the-irs-has-an-emergency-apocalypse-plan-to-collect-taxes/)\n\nNow everyone thinks that trump is in charge and he’s the one running this show, and on paper he is. However William Brockmann Long is really the HMFIC running this show. Billy is the one who is fundamentally in charge of making sure the United States has a plan to respond to any type of disaster. Trump might be the one saying “I’m doing X about Y” but really its FEMA who is calling the shots and advising the president, Trump is just pulling the trigger. So no matter how much of a babbling ape headed buffoon you think trump is its doesn’t matter because there is a whole team of level headed people behind him who’s one and only job is to manage emergencies.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HOW THIS RELATES TO THE ECONOMY:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Remember when I said FEMA is efficient as Fuck? Well most companies on the SPX are big enough to understand that large scale disasters have the ability to extremely fuck up their business. That’s why most large corporations have emergency disaster plans, much like FEMA’s, written down in advance incase anything happens. Walmart has an entire [Emergency Operations Center](https://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/hazards/upload/Walmart-Resliency_052316_v2.pdf) that runs 25/8 and its main job is to be on the look out and respond to emergencies that directly impact their company. Most major companies have departments like this model after NIMS and ICS. Here are some examples: [Disney emergency manager job posting](https://jobs.livecareer.com/l/crisis-management-planning-program-manager-disney-cac507473de325204963b6fc39139e51), [PPT presentation on Boeing’s emergency management system](https://ndiastorage.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ndia/2009/DIBCIP/Komendat.pdf), and [Amazon job posting for Emergency Management Director ](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/pm-emergency-response-and-business-continuity-at-amazon-1509562192)\n\nSo while investors might not have “priced in” the effects of this global disaster I can guarantee you almost every company on the SPX did, and they have a plan to overcome it. We already are seeing news articles about car companies repurposing their factories to make ventilators and cruise companies offering their ships to help house patients. While the general public might not have had a plan for a fast sweeping indiscriminate plague sized case of beer aids, I am willing to bet my entire life savings (&amp;lt;$50,000) on the fact that every major company out there has a binder on a shelf somewhere with a section in it detailing how the company should respond to a pandemic in order to mitigate any negative effects.\n\nSo while the investors might not have priced in the beer aids and stock fell like a fat bitch during an earthquake, most companies are well ahead of the curve. Majority of you will hate to hear this, but were close to the bottom. Give it one month and everything will be very close to being back to normal. Sure GDP might fall and a few smaller companies that weren’t prepared for a disaster will go under but in one months time there will be no reason for stock prices to continue to be falling.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: FEMA, DIS, WMT, et al. have priced in beer aids. Stonks only go up until they don’t, and the IRS will still taxes those gains after a nuke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;POS: SPY 3/23 $231/$232c, UUP 3/27 $28c DAL 4/17 $35c, CCL 4/17 $42.5c, F 6/19 $4p, TAK 7/17 $22.5c, GM 1/21 $47c&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

That great asset is also our greatest enemy because I would bet 90% of you autists don't understand how they work, so I am here today to try and help you out.\n\nWith such insane spikes in volatility (i.e. rises in IV on the option contracts), it is very easy to get fucked by \"IV crush.\" For those idiots who do not know what this means: IV Crush is when volatility (a key component of the option premium) decreases, causing your option contract to lose value, even if you called the directional move correctly. This happened on Thursday and Friday to many autists, including myself, due to the lower than usual volatility. Now, this volatility can translate to your advantage. If you were long puts at the start of the Rona Bear Market, you would have made massive tendies because you called **the direction and the increase in volatility.**\n\nAs with any market route, there is always a bounce, bull trap, dead cat bounce - whatever the fuck you want to call it. The fact is, we are incredibly oversold, and the markets will experience a partial recovery eventually. What I am showing you is that if you buy calls and the market slightly recovers you called **the direction but will experience a decrease in volatility.** This limits your output of tendies.\n\nI will use u/Variation-Separate and his call for a short term bottoming around 213 on the $SPY and take his rally to the 270 range. The obvious play if what he says happens is picking up 4/17 220c/230c/240c/250c/260c (whatever your preference) and riding the increase. The issue with this play is that your upside is going to be limited by IV crush. \n\nVolatility is measured most transparently for the $SPY using the $VIX, which has been pushing records during this market route. Using historical data, I took a look at the market volatility in 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2008 to show you that on relief rallies, after a significant pullback,the $VIX (aka the proxy for implied volatility on $SPY options) drastically decreases during market recoveries. **What this means: your long calls that you scooped up when $SPY was at 213 will not print as much because while $SPY may hit 270 and you will make some money, you are going to get IV crushed by the fall in volatility.**\n\n**The important takeaway:** on dead cat bounces / bull traps / market rallies, the $VIX significantly pulls back. Put another way, the IV on your $SPY calls decreases when markets rebound.\n\n**So how do I avoid getting IV crushed on the market rally?**\n\nHedge vega (the quantifiable proxy for IV on option pricing). Vega represents the change in an option value for a 1% change in IV. \n\nThe hedge is by going long $SPY calls, and hedging the vega by shorting the $VIX with puts. All you need to do is match up the vega of the $SPY call with the delta of the $VIX put.\n\n**The Hypothetical Trade:**\n\nLong $SPY 4/17 240c - trading at 9.65 a piece with a **vega** of 0.2404\n\nLong $VIX 4/15 52.5p - trading at 7.90 a piece with a **delta** of -0.2463\n\nThis essentially creates a vega-neutral position, aka Fuck Off IV Crush You Dumb Cuck. All you need to do is match up the vega of the $SPY call with the delta of the $VIX put, and you will be able to print massive tendies if you call the directional movement correct. However, since option greeks are constantly changing it is best to do this in a shorter time frame, so be nimble.\n\nIt should be noted this can be done using spreads or futures but that is 🌈 People keep bringing up IV on the $VIX, which does exist, and can be visualized with $VVIX. If you want a perfect hedge explore vol futures, otherwise you will face some IV crush on $VIX puts, but the hedge still holds up quite well. \n\n**tl;dr -** When the market bounces and you go long $SPY calls, avoid IV crush by buying puts on the $VIX. Just match up the $SPY call vega with the $VIX put delta. \n\nEnjoy the quarantine - 🌈🐶\n\nEdit:\n\nA lot are asking so it should be noted: if you were betting that $SPY would go down with puts, hedging IV is silly because drops in the $SPY almost always correlate to a higher $VIX, so you most likely won’t get IV crushed. However, if you still wanted to be Vega-neutral with $SPY puts, you would still use $VIX puts because Vega is a positive greek and you are still trying to hedge away a decrease in IV.",

This happened on Thursday and Friday to many autists, including myself, due to the lower than usual volatility. Now, this volatility can translate to your advantage. If you were long puts at the start of the Rona Bear Market, you would have made massive tendies because you called &lt;strong&gt;the direction and the increase in volatility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As with any market route, there is always a bounce, bull trap, dead cat bounce - whatever the fuck you want to call it. The fact is, we are incredibly oversold, and the markets will experience a partial recovery eventually.

We pretended to be the retards in the movie *The Big Short* who were investigating mortgage-unpaid houses. \n\n**1. We checked 22 Starbucks**, 16 of which are located along Yonge Street, basically the street with the most hobos in Toronto, i.e. the busiest street; the other 6 are just random picks in the areas that I am familiar. So this is not an accurate investigation. It is just two fellow retards pretending to be movie characters.\n\nFor locations' details please click [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ql0uzc7m91p515/Starbucks%20research.pdf?dl=0).\n\nIn summary, out of these 22 stores: \n\n* 11 out of 22 are Closed. The 11 closed ones are all in downtown area, near street and without drive-thru option. [For the same reason, many stores in the US major cities like Seattle would be closed.](https://i.imgur.com/J1danqf.jpg)\n* Only 1 store has drive-through and it is in suburban town. Drive-through staff said: “busy. Same amount of drive-thru people.”\n* 10 open maybe because they are essential to public service officers (police, fire department, hospital, etc.); still too many open but I do not know why. 1 claimed \"**1/8** of normal volume\", 1 claimed \"only 10 customers per hour compared to 800 when busiest\"\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. So let's do a very dumb calculation:** \n\n[70% of sales in the drive-thru enabled stores come from the drive-thru](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-24/as-starbucks-embraces-the-drive-thru-a-few-speed-traps-ahead)\n\n[60% of Starbucks locations have drive-thru capabilities](https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-closing-locations-keeping-drive-thru-open-2020-3) \n\nIf Starbucks keeps only drive-thru and some \"essential\" stores open, \n\nthe drive-thru stores will generate 70%\\*60% = 42% of regular volume, \n\nplus those \"essential\" stores, say 1/4 of the 40% non-drive-thru stores are open, which is 10% stores are open with only **1/8** of regular volume, equal to 1.25% of regular sales.\n\nThen the current sales would be 42% + 1.25 % = 43.25% of regular ones.\n\nBut due to the new \"30 days salary for baristas even not showing up\" policy, [a drive-thru store would be closed if most workers don't want to come](https://i.imgur.com/4eneoeT.jpg). The drive-thru stores will generate less than 42%.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nThe calculation above is dumb as fuck, with small sample size, stupid simple adds and multiplies, ignoring the difference between Canada and other markets, excluding many factors like delivery orders, other product sales, bluh bluh bluh. It is just to show an idea that how big the difference is. The sales volume could drop lower than 40% of regulars. Yes just put it as I just made the number up.\n\nWith such a big drop in the revenue, while still having to pay salaries, you can see how big the drop would be in their earnings. **Probably it will end up losing money in fiscal year 2020.**\n\nAnd yet, they would like to keep their [promise of 40m shares buyback](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/18/weve-got-a-strong-balance-sheet-starbucks-ceo-defends-buybacks.html).\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nThe calculation didn’t consider the drop that caused by people not buying coffee because staying at home or working from home.\n\n**3. Some of you might want to talk about Chinese market, saying** [**they will reopen 95% of stores by end of March**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-starbucks-sbux-stock-dividend-233311299.html)**.**\n\nBut,\n\nAccording to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/218366/number-of-international-and-us-starbucks-stores/), Starbucks has 31,256 stores worldwide (in 2019).\n\nUSA:13,189\n\nInternational: 15,041\n\nEdit: I don’t know why 13189+15041 is less than 31256 but the website said so. I assume the principle of addition is broken.\n\nOut of the internation 15,041 stores, Starbucks has 4,200 stores in China, according to [Starbucks in China](https://www.starbucks.com.cn/en/about/).\n\nChina's coffee market is growing rapidly but it is not a coffee-country. Drinking coffee is more of a show-off habbit among the white-collars in major cities. Most people don't drink coffee.\n\n* [The average Chinese still only drinks five cups per year, says the International Coffee Organisation, a London-based group.

We pretended to be the retards in the movie &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt; who were investigating mortgage-unpaid houses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. We checked 22 Starbucks&lt;/strong&gt;, 16 of which are located along Yonge Street, basically the street with the most hobos in Toronto, i.e. the busiest street; the other 6 are just random picks in the areas that I am familiar. So this is not an accurate investigation. It is just two fellow retards pretending to be movie characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For locations&amp;#39; details please click &lt;a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ql0uzc7m91p515/Starbucks%20research.pdf?dl=0\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In summary, out of these 22 stores: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;11 out of 22 are Closed. The 11 closed ones are all in downtown area, near street and without drive-thru option. &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/J1danqf.jpg\"&gt;For the same reason, many stores in the US major cities like Seattle would be closed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Only 1 store has drive-through and it is in suburban town. Drive-through staff said: “busy. Same amount of drive-thru people.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10 open maybe because they are essential to public service officers (police, fire department, hospital, etc.); still too many open but I do not know why. 1 claimed &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;1/8&lt;/strong&gt; of normal volume&amp;quot;, 1 claimed &amp;quot;only 10 customers per hour compared to 800 when busiest&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. So let&amp;#39;s do a very dumb calculation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-24/as-starbucks-embraces-the-drive-thru-a-few-speed-traps-ahead\"&gt;70% of sales in the drive-thru enabled stores come from the drive-thru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-closing-locations-keeping-drive-thru-open-2020-3\"&gt;60% of Starbucks locations have drive-thru capabilities&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Starbucks keeps only drive-thru and some &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot; stores open, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the drive-thru stores will generate 70%*60% = 42% of regular volume, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;plus those &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot; stores, say 1/4 of the 40% non-drive-thru stores are open, which is 10% stores are open with only &lt;strong&gt;1/8&lt;/strong&gt; of regular volume, equal to 1.25% of regular sales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the current sales would be 42% + 1.25 % = 43.25% of regular ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But due to the new &amp;quot;30 days salary for baristas even not showing up&amp;quot; policy, &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/4eneoeT.jpg\"&gt;a drive-thru store would be closed if most workers don&amp;#39;t want to come&lt;/a&gt;. The drive-thru stores will generate less than 42%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The calculation above is dumb as fuck, with small sample size, stupid simple adds and multiplies, ignoring the difference between Canada and other markets, excluding many factors like delivery orders, other product sales, bluh bluh bluh. It is just to show an idea that how big the difference is. The sales volume could drop lower than 40% of regulars. Yes just put it as I just made the number up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With such a big drop in the revenue, while still having to pay salaries, you can see how big the drop would be in their earnings. &lt;strong&gt;Probably it will end up losing money in fiscal year 2020.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, they would like to keep their &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/18/weve-got-a-strong-balance-sheet-starbucks-ceo-defends-buybacks.html\"&gt;promise of 40m shares buyback&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The calculation didn’t consider the drop that caused by people not buying coffee because staying at home or working from home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Some of you might want to talk about Chinese market, saying&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-starbucks-sbux-stock-dividend-233311299.html\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;they will reopen 95% of stores by end of March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/218366/number-of-international-and-us-starbucks-stores/\"&gt;Statista&lt;/a&gt;, Starbucks has 31,256 stores worldwide (in 2019).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;USA:13,189&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;International: 15,041&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I don’t know why 13189+15041 is less than 31256 but the website said so. I assume the principle of addition is broken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out of the internation 15,041 stores, Starbucks has 4,200 stores in China, according to &lt;a href=\"https://www.starbucks.com.cn/en/about/\"&gt;Starbucks in China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;China&amp;#39;s coffee market is growing rapidly but it is not a coffee-country. Drinking coffee is more of a show-off habbit among the white-collars in major cities. Most people don&amp;#39;t drink coffee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.economist.com/china/2019/05/23/china-is-a-nation-of-tea-drinkers-but-coffee-is-taking-off\"&gt;The average Chinese still only drinks five cups per year, says the International Coffee Organisation, a London-based group.

VIX support looks to be around 49.5-55. If you aren't as stupid as you look you can pause pornhub for five seconds and figure the rest out from there. \n\nHope everybody did their own DD after I tipped you off on my VIX play and made some hot tendies. \n\nFirst things first, we didn't quite hit 220 be EOW (228 but fuck you I was pretty close and I didn't promise shit.)\n\nWell now i'm setting up my next play and it looks like atleast two of you shit-sticks aren't completely autistic  cause you both beat me to the fucking punch. Shout out to u/bigd0g111 and u/Variation-Seperate for basically saying what I am about to say with different DD and logic.\n\n[https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix) So DPI started to sky rocket. I don't necessarily think we have bottomed yet, but we are getting close. If any of you retards watch the time&amp;sales they would see big fucking orders flying around everywhere like granny titties which i see as big players positioning themselves for the rebound.

I have always believed 210 was our temporary support/bottom and I will look to taking my position there. However it is entirely possible that we don't quite get that low. If we bounce extremely hard (very possible with how gamma is positioned) I believe we will top out at 2825ish. \n\nDaily: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/G5Zy9GtC/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/G5Zy9GtC/)\n\nYou can see the Kijun-sen line i am targeting as the top. I am also a strong believer that volume is the best thing to watch in these falling knife situations. they will disclose where the big players have offloaded/taken their positions. If you notice the February 28th day that i have marked you can see how i predicted the last temporary bottom. Abnormal volume. Notice it doesn't have to be extremely large, it could also be very very low (indicating selling pressure has dryed up like your gf vag when you around).\n\nNow if you're retarded you are seeing this as an opportunity to long SPY or whatever the fuck when volatility is so goddamn high that you will get ass fucked. I have been exclusively trading the VIX during this past month which comes with its own dangers (euro options not American) but the bright side is i find the puts somewhat cheap (calls are very much not). So if i have to spell it out for you, buy VIX puts when we bottom to around 210. \n\nVIX: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/b5YGUBHz/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/b5YGUBHz/)\n\nI expect VIX to be swinging quite wildly for the next couple weeks. I see 49.5-55 as the support (and i am favoring the lower end of that range). As it rises to 85+ Ill be looking at cheap puts. Ride the (sex) swings faggot. \n\nAlot of you eager beavers have been messaging me nonstop with questions. So to alleviate some of that shit i am going to write it out here. \n\n* I recommend \"reminisces of a stock operator\" discussing Jesse Livermore's life and John Murphy's \"Technical Analysis of the Futures Market\".\n* I am not your fucking financial advisor so don't ask me what the fuck you should do.\n* Stop fucking messaging me \"Do YoU sTiLl ThInK .....\" Yes fucker. I still do if i posted it. Unless i post otherwise fuck off...\n* WhAt Is YoUr NeXt PlAy? Maybe if you did your own DD and stopped believing shit like Quad Witch BS then you wouldn't keep losing your parents allowance you fucking cuck.\n\nOTHER than that if you have legit questions about TA etc. I am always happy to help (ya filthy retards). \n\nDo your own DD and don't take positions off random ppl on the internet (stranger danger). \n\nGL",

Some people like a lot of other studies, that's fine but I feel it's unnecessary. If you are just using a line graph or robinhood charts, you deserve to lose money. \n\nThe SPY went sideways this week for an important reason. You clearly see the SPY tried to retest $255 6 times, then it tested $250 5 times. Why is $250-255 important? Bottom chart - The first bottom is Feb 2018, the next one is March-April 2018 which is around $250.  The SPY then bottomed in Dec 2018 at $235 (no screenshot, go look at a fucking graph).\n\nIf you guys would get an actual charting software you might not have gotten burnt at the witching hour. I loaded up on SPY 4/13 $200 puts, about 20mins before the close. Why? Because it failed to break out over that $235 resistance (Dec 2018 low). Now we are fully under major support levels, we we should go to the next support at $213, which is around Oct 2016 levels. I know everyone is mad that WSBs was wrong about the witcher, but it's still good to listen to people, form a hypothesis of what you think might happen, then let the graph tell you if it's correct or not in real time. \n\nMy next move - Selling my puts Monday or Tuesday, if we get below $215. Watching for the stimulus bill to pass, as once that happens, I believe the SPY will try to retest $250 again, maybe even $270. You can try to get calls for this, but you gota be quick and be ready to exit. Once it hits $250, I'll be looking to load up on late April-may puts. \n\nPositions -  https://imgur.com/OkMjCWo \n\nTl/dr - Get a real fucking chart.

Just wanted to give some of my perspective on the recent PR involving Amazon. \n\nYou've probably heard that Amazon is aiming to hire 100,000 new employees. As of this week my company has had more routes to drive, but every route is about 60% of a normal sized one. So the idea that there's more work/volume seems like a myth to me. They're just reducing everyone's work and spreading it out to more people. \n\nWhen Amazon does these mass hirings (like around Christmas), it's pretty much guaranteed they won't keep more than 20% of the new hires, and to offset the ones they keep, they'll let go of poor performers who have been there a while. My manager literally told me of the 7 people they just hired, they'll only keep 1-2 of them in the next 90 days. \n\nThey're just taking advantage of this influx of desperate unemployed bastards hoping that 1 in 10 of em isn't a total fucking retard. \n\nAlso worth knowing that it doesn't seem like Amazon gives a single fuck about spreading this virus to the whole damn country. There have been practically zero precautions set in place for drivers. We don't have to wear gloves, masks, anything. They're not screening drivers for illness, so I bet there are plenty of Amazon drivers infected throughout the US right now that are delivering this virus to 500-600 people weekly. Amazon is tiptoeing a giant fucking cliff and so far dominating the PR of the whole situation. But I see through it. \n\nI'm also typing this on the clock. With all the money you make with this info you'll probably be able to afford Amazon Prime, and some retard will deliver the tenders straight to your fucken door. \n\nAMZN 1/1/21 1000p",

          "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nListen up autists because you are about to get your ass saved by this knowledge I'm about to drop on you. Because today we're going to learn about hedging strategies. I've noticed that some of us may be confused on how to limit downside risk.\n\nFor those of you lazy bananas just waiting for the TLDR, well here it is: 3/27 270c; 3/27 200p. You're going to have to read to figure out why buying both is useful.\n\nFirst, let's get clear on what a **hedge** refers to. According to Investopedia:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;A hedge is an investment to reduce the risk of adverse price movements in an asset. Normally, a hedge consists of taking an offsetting position in a related security. In plain-speak, a hedge is placing the opposite or comparable bet to make sure your ass is saved if everything goes tits up.^(1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelieve it or not, but options are not just for playing the market like casino chips. In fact, they can be used in combination with regular stock, or along with other assets, to reduce risk and maximize returns.\n\nOptions accomplish 2 primary things:\n\n1. They allow us to control for downside risk, similar to buying car insurance for your speed demon of a wife. When you buy puts you are protecting yourself from losses if your long position goes tits up.\n2. They allow us to leverage our existing assets for greater returns. Similar to renting out your condo to buy more rental condos. Similarly, you can \"rent out\" stocks that you own by selling *covered calls or puts*, a concept we will discuss further down. This is where Theta gang get their tendies.\n\n**I am going to discuss a few basic tools to save your fanny in the event that the tide swings the other way.** This happens quickly, as we saw Friday. Unless you fart magic you're not going to predict when it will shift. Luckily, you don't need to with these simple tricks.\n\n**Trick #1: The Straddle** \\- It's not just what your wife does to the neighbor while you film. It is also what you can use when you don't know whether witches will appear as promised, or stone cold warlocks will grab your balls and squeeze them for max pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A long straddle is a combination of buying a call and buying a put, both with the same strike price and expiration. Together, they produce a position that should profit if the stock makes a bigly move either up or down.\\[2\\]](https://preview.redd.it/xstf9d2fz9o41.png?width=376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c6921819a3cdf95f0a44a76f34584f1c3359e69)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, the the above scenario may come in handy for days like Monday where we are all basically 50/50 whether it will be upsies or downsies. It is the Schrodinger's cat of options plays. Except, either of the two states will result is an alive portfolio.\n\nLiterally can't go tits up, unless it goes sideways.. Which leads us to:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A short straddle is an options strategy comprised of selling both a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date. It is used when the trader believes the underlying asset will not move significantly higher or lower over the lives of the options contracts.](https://preview.redd.it/fc43n1glz9o41.png?width=375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a69cb9f69f0eaecde065ce46ad78e33a44288b63)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUse the above scenario when the underlying asset is trading inside a defined range. Be careful, because any escape up or down will mean certain doom. You should be aware that selling a call and a put implies that you own shares of the underlying security, otherwise you will be on the hook to purchase if it goes the wrong direction.\n\nWhen it comes to buying straddles you need a decent amount of cash to buy both a call and put for the same strike price. Also, what if you are certain that the stonk will go up but still want some downside protection? That leads us to:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Trick #2: The Strangle**\n\nA strangle is a more cost-effective way to hedge while still maintaining a position on a direction of a security. It involves purchasing an opposite position with a different strike price. The strike price can be OTM or NTM depending on how much you would like to control for downside risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;A strangle is an options strategy where the investor holds a position in both a [call](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call.asp) and a [put](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp) option with different [strike prices](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp), but with the same expiration date and underlying asset. A strangle is a good strategy if you think the underlying security will experience a large price movement in the near future but are unsure of the direction. However, it is profitable mainly if the asset does swing sharply in price.^(3)\n\nExample: Say Friday you decided to hedge on witches and bought an SPY 3/20 $280c like a retard. Had you also purchased an SPY 3/20 200p you may have come out ahead, or at least retained your principal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The long strangle, also known as buy strangle or simply \\\\\"strangle\\\\\", is a neutral strategy in options trading that involve the simultaneous buying of a slightly out-of-the-money put and a slightly out-of-the-money call of the same underlying stock and expiration date. Long Strangle Construction.](https://preview.redd.it/ftnv7cfsz9o41.png?width=376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cd31e9172d729ff696343db774128e31751a536)\n\nJust as with straddles, strangles can go long or short. To retain a position on a security that you expect to trade sideways you can use the short strangle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The short strangle, also known as sell strangle, is a neutral strategy in options trading that involve the simultaneous selling of a slightly out-of-the-money put and a slightly out-of-the-money call of the same underlying stock and expiration date.](https://preview.redd.it/zig2ywmyz9o41.png?width=376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30154fc8dec56edaeb9d0d52456cf28d7036d837)\n\nMaximum profit for the short strangle occurs when the underlying stock price on expiration date is trading between the strike prices of the options sold. At this price, both options expire worthless and the options trader gets to keep the entire initial credit taken as profit.^(4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Trick #3: Selling Call Options** \\- You may hear a lot of people throw around Theta gang. They are referring to the type of options play where you sell a call option via 'sell to open' on a security that they own. If they do not own the security they are selling a 'naked call' which can be risky if the play goes the wrong way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A covered call is an options strategy involving trades in both the underlying stock and an option contract. The trader buys \\(or already owns\\) the underlying stock. They will then sell call options for the same number \\(or less\\) of shares held and then wait for the option contract to be exercised or to expire.](https://preview.redd.it/aovk2pm8v9o41.jpg?width=296&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b1058572c74036ddf9d6dab52d957b60b48ac8e)\n\nThis is the most basic way to profit from your portfolio in a situation where the stock may not move up in price. That way you can keep your shitty JNUG shares and earn money while they slowly move down to $1. Just sell an OTM call, but make sure that you have at least 100 shares of JNUG for each contract sold otherwise you'll have a margin call if it goes up beyond your strike price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Trick #4: Credit Spread** \\- In finance, a credit spread, or net credit spread is an options strategy that involves a purchase of one option and a sale of another option in the same class and expiration but different strike prices. It is designed to make a profit when the spreads between the two options narrows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The call credit spread is a bearish to neutral options trading strategy that capitalizes on theta decay and downward price moves in the underlying asset. It is comprised of a short call and a long call, and is sometimes also referred to as a “bear call spread.”](https://preview.redd.it/6g2tvw6ow9o41.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8734083c097757a6b3c8031cf8b4479bdff76912)\n\nThe call credit spread option strategy also works in minimally rising markets, as the trade will be entirely profitable if the underlying asset closes below short call strike price at option expiration.^(5)\n\nExample:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Stock XYZ is trading at $50 a share.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sell 53 call for $0.50  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Buy 55 call for $0.20  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The net credit received for this trade is $0.30 ($30).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The best case scenario for a call credit spread is for the underlying instrument, stock XYZ in this case, to move down or stay the same. If stock XYZ is anywhere below $53 at expiration (the price of the short strike), this trade would be a full winer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake care to review the below resources and watch some YouTube to fully understand these plays before partaking. It is important that you understand how to properly leverage and control for risk to avoid a massive GUH when you fuck up.\n\nOne of the most practical applications of the above strategies is to hedge against the decline in VIX to control for IV decay. /u/bigd0g111 does an excellent job of explaining this in their post on [how to avoid IV Crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmshcv/when_market_bounce_inevitably_comesdont_scream/):\n\n&gt;Hedge vega (the quantifiable proxy for IV on option pricing). Vega represents the change in an option value for a 1% change in IV.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The hedge is by going long $SPY calls, and hedging the vega by shorting the $VIX with puts. All you need to do is match up the vega of the $SPY call with the delta of the $VIX put.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Hypothetical Trade:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Long $SPY 4/17 240c - trading at 9.65 a piece with a **vega** of 0.2404  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Long $VIX 4/15 52.5p - trading at 7.90 a piece with a **delta** of -0.2463\n\nIf you autists aren't taking the bare minimum protections to hedge against downside risk, especially for VIX then you have no-one to blame but yourself if you get pinched.\n\nTake a read of the post(s) I mention above and be sure to ask any silly questions below if you get stuck. Remember, there are no silly questions, just silly people. Thanks and goodnight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

Because today we&amp;#39;re going to learn about hedging strategies. I&amp;#39;ve noticed that some of us may be confused on how to limit downside risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those of you lazy bananas just waiting for the TLDR, well here it is: 3/27 270c; 3/27 200p. You&amp;#39;re going to have to read to figure out why buying both is useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#39;s get clear on what a &lt;strong&gt;hedge&lt;/strong&gt; refers to. According to Investopedia:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A hedge is an investment to reduce the risk of adverse price movements in an asset. Normally, a hedge consists of taking an offsetting position in a related security. In plain-speak, a hedge is placing the opposite or comparable bet to make sure your ass is saved if everything goes tits up.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, but options are not just for playing the market like casino chips. In fact, they can be used in combination with regular stock, or along with other assets, to reduce risk and maximize returns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Options accomplish 2 primary things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They allow us to control for downside risk, similar to buying car insurance for your speed demon of a wife. When you buy puts you are protecting yourself from losses if your long position goes tits up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They allow us to leverage our existing assets for greater returns. Similar to renting out your condo to buy more rental condos. Similarly, you can &amp;quot;rent out&amp;quot; stocks that you own by selling &lt;em&gt;covered calls or puts&lt;/em&gt;, a concept we will discuss further down. This is where Theta gang get their tendies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am going to discuss a few basic tools to save your fanny in the event that the tide swings the other way.&lt;/strong&gt; This happens quickly, as we saw Friday. Unless you fart magic you&amp;#39;re not going to predict when it will shift. Luckily, you don&amp;#39;t need to with these simple tricks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trick #1: The Straddle&lt;/strong&gt; - It&amp;#39;s not just what your wife does to the neighbor while you film. It is also what you can use when you don&amp;#39;t know whether witches will appear as promised, or stone cold warlocks will grab your balls and squeeze them for max pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xstf9d2fz9o41.png?width=376&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4c6921819a3cdf95f0a44a76f34584f1c3359e69\"&gt;A long straddle is a combination of buying a call and buying a put, both with the same strike price and expiration. Together, they produce a position that should profit if the stock makes a bigly move either up or down.[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the the above scenario may come in handy for days like Monday where we are all basically 50/50 whether it will be upsies or downsies. It is the Schrodinger&amp;#39;s cat of options plays. Except, either of the two states will result is an alive portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally can&amp;#39;t go tits up, unless it goes sideways.. Which leads us to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fc43n1glz9o41.png?width=375&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a69cb9f69f0eaecde065ce46ad78e33a44288b63\"&gt;A short straddle is an options strategy comprised of selling both a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date. It is used when the trader believes the underlying asset will not move significantly higher or lower over the lives of the options contracts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use the above scenario when the underlying asset is trading inside a defined range. Be careful, because any escape up or down will mean certain doom. You should be aware that selling a call and a put implies that you own shares of the underlying security, otherwise you will be on the hook to purchase if it goes the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to buying straddles you need a decent amount of cash to buy both a call and put for the same strike price. Also, what if you are certain that the stonk will go up but still want some downside protection? That leads us to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trick #2: The Strangle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A strangle is a more cost-effective way to hedge while still maintaining a position on a direction of a security. It involves purchasing an opposite position with a different strike price. The strike price can be OTM or NTM depending on how much you would like to control for downside risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A strangle is an options strategy where the investor holds a position in both a &lt;a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call.asp\"&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp\"&gt;put&lt;/a&gt; option with different &lt;a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp\"&gt;strike prices&lt;/a&gt;, but with the same expiration date and underlying asset. A strangle is a good strategy if you think the underlying security will experience a large price movement in the near future but are unsure of the direction. However, it is profitable mainly if the asset does swing sharply in price.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example: Say Friday you decided to hedge on witches and bought an SPY 3/20 $280c like a retard. Had you also purchased an SPY 3/20 200p you may have come out ahead, or at least retained your principal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ftnv7cfsz9o41.png?width=376&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1cd31e9172d729ff696343db774128e31751a536\"&gt;The long strangle, also known as buy strangle or simply \\&amp;quot;strangle\\&amp;quot;, is a neutral strategy in options trading that involve the simultaneous buying of a slightly out-of-the-money put and a slightly out-of-the-money call of the same underlying stock and expiration date. Long Strangle Construction.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as with straddles, strangles can go long or short. To retain a position on a security that you expect to trade sideways you can use the short strangle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zig2ywmyz9o41.png?width=376&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=30154fc8dec56edaeb9d0d52456cf28d7036d837\"&gt;The short strangle, also known as sell strangle, is a neutral strategy in options trading that involve the simultaneous selling of a slightly out-of-the-money put and a slightly out-of-the-money call of the same underlying stock and expiration date.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maximum profit for the short strangle occurs when the underlying stock price on expiration date is trading between the strike prices of the options sold. At this price, both options expire worthless and the options trader gets to keep the entire initial credit taken as profit.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trick #3: Selling Call Options&lt;/strong&gt; - You may hear a lot of people throw around Theta gang. They are referring to the type of options play where you sell a call option via &amp;#39;sell to open&amp;#39; on a security that they own. If they do not own the security they are selling a &amp;#39;naked call&amp;#39; which can be risky if the play goes the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/aovk2pm8v9o41.jpg?width=296&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6b1058572c74036ddf9d6dab52d957b60b48ac8e\"&gt;A covered call is an options strategy involving trades in both the underlying stock and an option contract. The trader buys (or already owns) the underlying stock. They will then sell call options for the same number (or less) of shares held and then wait for the option contract to be exercised or to expire.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the most basic way to profit from your portfolio in a situation where the stock may not move up in price. That way you can keep your shitty JNUG shares and earn money while they slowly move down to $1. Just sell an OTM call, but make sure that you have at least 100 shares of JNUG for each contract sold otherwise you&amp;#39;ll have a margin call if it goes up beyond your strike price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trick #4: Credit Spread&lt;/strong&gt; - In finance, a credit spread, or net credit spread is an options strategy that involves a purchase of one option and a sale of another option in the same class and expiration but different strike prices. It is designed to make a profit when the spreads between the two options narrows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6g2tvw6ow9o41.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8734083c097757a6b3c8031cf8b4479bdff76912\"&gt;The call credit spread is a bearish to neutral options trading strategy that capitalizes on theta decay and downward price moves in the underlying asset. It is comprised of a short call and a long call, and is sometimes also referred to as a “bear call spread.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The call credit spread option strategy also works in minimally rising markets, as the trade will be entirely profitable if the underlying asset closes below short call strike price at option expiration.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stock XYZ is trading at $50 a share.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sell 53 call for $0.50  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buy 55 call for $0.20  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The net credit received for this trade is $0.30 ($30).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best case scenario for a call credit spread is for the underlying instrument, stock XYZ in this case, to move down or stay the same. If stock XYZ is anywhere below $53 at expiration (the price of the short strike), this trade would be a full winer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take care to review the below resources and watch some YouTube to fully understand these plays before partaking. It is important that you understand how to properly leverage and control for risk to avoid a massive GUH when you fuck up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the most practical applications of the above strategies is to hedge against the decline in VIX to control for IV decay. &lt;a href=\"/u/bigd0g111\"&gt;/u/bigd0g111&lt;/a&gt; does an excellent job of explaining this in their post on &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmshcv/when_market_bounce_inevitably_comesdont_scream/\"&gt;how to avoid IV Crush&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hedge vega (the quantifiable proxy for IV on option pricing). Vega represents the change in an option value for a 1% change in IV.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hedge is by going long $SPY calls, and hedging the vega by shorting the $VIX with puts. All you need to do is match up the vega of the $SPY call with the delta of the $VIX put.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hypothetical Trade:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long $SPY 4/17 240c - trading at 9.65 a piece with a &lt;strong&gt;vega&lt;/strong&gt; of 0.2404  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long $VIX 4/15 52.5p - trading at 7.90 a piece with a &lt;strong&gt;delta&lt;/strong&gt; of -0.2463&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you autists aren&amp;#39;t taking the bare minimum protections to hedge against downside risk, especially for VIX then you have no-one to blame but yourself if you get pinched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a read of the post(s) I mention above and be sure to ask any silly questions below if you get stuck. Remember, there are no silly questions, just silly people. Thanks and goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp\"&gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-strangle.aspx\"&gt;https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-strangle.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strangle.asp\"&gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strangle.asp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-strangle.aspx\"&gt;https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-strangle.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.optionsbro.com/call-credit-spread-option-strategy-example/\"&gt;https://www.optionsbro.com/call-credit-spread-option-strategy-example/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I don’t have a degree in finance, I trade options as a hobby, and I fuckin love the banter that goes on in this sub.  Being that the select few actually who know things about options do me the kindness of posting their well thought out DD, I figured I’d give some of my own DD on the various outcomes and their possible lengths of time so that we can all stop speculating about tHiS WiLl Be oVeR iN tWo WeEkS or the alternative doomsday hypotheses.  The data I’ll be going off is how the world is currently in terms of the rapidity of rising cases. We’ll use this to speculate different outcomes from here so we can all time the market and donate to our local healthcare organizations on payday.\n\nAs I’m writing this, in the US we have rapidly spreading cases in the areas where COVID-19 is present (NY, WA, CA, and NJ is up and coming).  In those places life as we know it has shut down.  In the smaller cities in the US and states with &lt; 100 cases, things are ramping up but big change hasn’t yet been enacted.  We have increased testing, which certainly can account for some of the increased reporting of cases, regardless our doubling time is now around 24-36 hours.  This is why governor Newsom of CA enacted the statewide shutdown, because if he didn’t, with the doubling time there would be 26 million people infected in 8 weeks. This is not unique to New York or California, they simply are a few weeks ahead of the states that are only reporting double digit cases as of today.  A quarter of Americans are on functional lockdown, if it hasn’t gotten to you yet, the shutdown is coming.\n\nI think the naysayers are becoming fewer and fewer as the world wakes up to the gravity of the situation, but I would like to say at this point our biggest enemy is the rapidly decreasing doubling time, and the only way to fight it is through quarantine and social distancing. Flattening the curve is imperative, if we don’t we are risk of overwhelming our healthcare system resulting in full wartime triage mode as has happened in [parts of Italy](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-triage-patients-who-need-intensive-care/).\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nThere are a few scenarios.\n\n# \n\n# A drug that is already approved and widely produced is found to be effective in treating COVID-19.\n\nThis is the best-case scenario.  One example is the drug that was shuttled through the pipelines this week is hydroxychloroquine (I hate the stuff, makes water taste like chlorine for 8 hours after you take it) -- it’s a drug that’s been used for years to treat malaria.  There isn’t a beautiful double-blinded placebo-controlled case series for use of it in COVID-19, but I laid eyes on the prelim data they’re talking about and the anecdotal evidence for treatment seems hopeful at least.  In theory, this would work how Tamiflu works for influenza --- it won’t “cure” COVID-19, but it would save us all by decreasing the burden on the healthcare system by decreasing the duration and severity of symptoms in those infected. Speaking to an epidemiologist, if we have a treatment such as this it will downgrade the pandemic to a containable pandemic.\n\n**For the market:**\n\nA successful, already approved, mass-producible, safe medication to reduce severity of illness is the ONLY scenario I can see in which we could maybe have the “V-shaped return” of the market our Commander in Chief is touting.  I still don’t think it will be V-shaped by any means, but at least the uncertainty of apocalypse would wane in the coming weeks.\n\n**Issues with this:**  Production and distribution.  It would be slow, and then it would be a bit faster, but still slow, and then it would pick up, but not enough to make everyone happy.  The silver lining here:  Trump signed the Defense Production Act, which means we could potentially have every capable pharmaceutical company work together to make millions of units a month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# An already available drug doesn’t work, and a different drug is approved as successful treatment\n\nThe drugs Gilead, Regeneron, and others are working on function similarly to Tamiflu, a viral neuraminidase inhibitor, which basically inhibits an enzyme that allows the virus to successfully replicate.  This could work beautifully, but it would take a while.\n\n**For the market:**\n\nIf the existing drugs don’t work, the fastest timeline (even with Trump lifting red tape) to get a new drug approved and start producing is on the order of months, during which time the number of cases continues in [an exponential curve](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) and we reach millions infected from the unchecked spread.\n\n**Issues with this:**\n\nSlower timeline / potentially low yield reward – we make drugs like this all the time, and sometimes you spend years developing a new protease inhibitor or a drug to stop viral entry into the cell and they simply don’t work.  That’s why HIV was initially so hard to treat with drugs: every time we’d block a receptor for cell entry it would just use a different one, every time we blocked an enzyme the virus uses it would just use a different one to circumvent. HAART therapy for HIV that we finally landed on as successful treatment blocks cell entry and inhibits several different enzymes to cripple the virus via different pathways at the same time. We all know how that went in the 80s -- it could take years to come up with a successful combination therapy to give COVID the ol’ 1-2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Existing drugs don’t work, the new drugs we’re making aren’t effective, and we have to wait for a vaccine.\n\nThe sentence above doesn’t sound all that bad until you really think about it.  The absolute fastest we could make a vaccine available to the public on a mass scale  is probably around a year from now.  There are so many problems with finding a vaccine that works at every step:  find an antigen (a structure that an antibody can bind to) that the virus will always express to target; find an antigen that we can make specific antibodies to; how long will immunity last? Can we do it without using live virus particles?\n\nHIV has been around for decades, and we now have control of the virus through therapy (downgrades it in terms of pandemic severity, right??).  So why don’t we have a vaccine?  Two reasons -- one because the sugar-proteins present on the outside of the virus are similar to sugar-proteins present in a lot of cells in our own body, so its very difficult to make antibodies to them.  The second reason is because HIV destroys your immune system, [but that's not important right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLpBtDRkuD8).  The idea here is that a vaccine could work if we find the right target, but then you have to see if it’s safe (do people die when you give it to them? Do they get sick? How sick?)  You have to see if it works (Do people get COVID-19 when you give it to them? *How do you know they don’t*? How many people get it?  Does it stop infection by 100% or 50%?)  Basically after it’s deemed safe, you have to make sure it’s effective by giving it to people and putting them out into the population to see if they get COVID, if they don’t then you go back and start mass producing it and give to more people, reassess and repeat.  If the vaccine isn’t effective and patients do get COVID, or perhaps even *if more of them get it* (which happened with some HIV vaccine trials) then you’re back to the drawing board, and repeat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What does the world look like if we have to wait 12-18 months for a treatment?**\n\nIn my opinion?  Worldwide quarantine, worldwide social distancing.  No air travel unless you have an approved reason, complete shutting of international borders, probably shutting of state borders.  A world without treatment and without a vaccine *is a bad world*.  New York City was called to shutdown after just 250 cases.  There simply isn’t a world in which we could get below a few hundred cases in *any major city* without very successful treatment or a vaccine.  What does this look like for the next 12-18 months?  Quarantine for weeks, cases drop from tens of thousands to hundreds, perhaps double digits, loosen restrictions, life returns to semi-normal, then cases jump, quarantine for weeks… repeat.  The virus is spread so easily, the first reported case in the United States was 9 weeks ago tomorrow, and now we’re in the tens of thousands.  The only way to stop spread is to have a treatment for current infections or go to zero cases, otherwise it’s just a waxing and waning quarantined / global shutdown life until we get a vaccine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How does the market look in this scenario?**\n\nPuts on life as we know it, my dudes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The final broad range scenario** is a treatment is ineffective, no new drugs work, and a vaccine isn’t as effective as we want it to be.  In this scenario, some small percentage of the world dies (0.5% mortality would be in the 10s of millions), and we just rely on [herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity) to eventually get us through it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The good news\n\nSo, **the good news** is there are a lot of different scenarios in which this will become a very scary thing of the past, as any one of these scenarios (except the last) could produce effective therapy, or any combination of them could work too – hey, maybe hydroxychloroquine is somewhat effective, we get a few new Tamiflu-like drugs, and we get a vaccine in a year.  You would never know it from this, but I’m quite the optimist, and I tend to think something along these lines is the more likely outcome rather than nothing works and we wait at home for a year for the world to go back to normal.  Either way, the bottom line is:  this isn’t almost over.  The 2-4 week self-quarantines are the first step, not the solution. You need to get that in your heads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# In the meantime:\n\nFlattening the curve – follow your local recommendations please.  Socially distance yourselves.  Have skype drinking parties.  Jack off across the room from your bro, not next to him.\n\nProtect your elders – buy them groceries, encourage them to stop going to public places, go to pick up supplies for them, explain how they are at risk (mortality rates are around 8-10% for those in their 70s, 14%+ for those in their 80s).  Otherwise healthy 60, 70, 80 year-olds are also at risk, it isn’t just gran with a heart condition.\n\nStay safe.  Be smart.  Wash your hands.  Don’t be dickhole and scoff at quarantines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Disclaimer – this is all speculation.  I will not give individual medical advice.  If you have questions about your health or that of a loved one please contact your physician or go in person for evaluation and treatment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:  TL;DR for the most of you:  From a medical standpoint, this isn't almost over.  There are a lot of ways to return to normalcy, the best of them would see life back to normal on the order of  months, the worst could be 1-2 years -- with variable economic fallout depending on what your poison is. Protect your elders and be smart about not contributing to the spread.  Volatility is still very high. Use it to your advantage if you want. ",

If you have questions about your health or that of a loved one please contact your physician or go in person for evaluation and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:  TL;DR for the most of you:  From a medical standpoint, this isn&amp;#39;t almost over.  There are a lot of ways to return to normalcy, the best of them would see life back to normal on the order of  months, the worst could be 1-2 years -- with variable economic fallout depending on what your poison is. Protect your elders and be smart about not contributing to the spread.  Volatility is still very high. Use it to your advantage if you want. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Hello, airline CEOs! We understand that you would like us to provide you with at least $54 billion so that you can avoid bankruptcy. Please understand that times are tough for us, too. Lots of us are getting hammered. Two years ago, our government enacted a corporate tax cut that saved you and other US companies hundreds of billions of dollars. This tax cut benefited you and your shareholders, but it also ballooned our annual government deficit to more than $1 trillion a year. \n\nWith the coronavirus now plunging our economy into recession, our tax revenue will tank, and our deficit will skyrocket even more, perhaps to $2 trillion or $3 trillion per year. So we're not as flush as we should have been. \n\nAs you know well your business is cyclical. So cyclical in fact that many of you have already gone bankrupt in the past. So you could have saved this cash for a rainy day. But you didn't.\n\nAlthough the coronavirus pandemic is bad luck, it was not unforeseeable. In fact, at least one of your members, American Airlines, explicitly foresaw it. In recent financial filings, American cited \"outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior\" as a major risk to its business. \n\nSo, while we sympathize with your plight, please understand that we're not going to just \"grant\" you the money. You and your shareholders and lenders knew the risks you were taking, and, for more than a decade, you enjoyed the rewards. \n\nAlso, you aren't the only ones who need our help. Just ask the cruise lines, hotel companies, and restaurants, bars, gyms, and other establishments in so many of our American communities that have been forced to close altogether —as well as the millions of Americans who will soon be laid off. \n\nSo, your $54+ billion bailout will be structured as follows: \n\n 1. A senior, secured credit line that will allow you to borrow the money you need to operate and pay your taxes while you figure out how to survive. \n\n2. This credit line will pay interest at a rate that compensates taxpayers for the use of our money and the risks we are taking. \n\n3. The use of this credit line will also require you to issue equity to taxpayers to allow us to share in your recoveries, if any. Yes, this equity issuance will dilute your shareholders and cause your stock prices to drop. But not as much as they will if you go bust. \n\n4. Our credit line, moreover, will be senior to all of your other debt and secured by your airplanes and other assets. If, despite our help, you fail, we will sell your airplanes and recoup 100 cents on our dollars before any of your other lenders get a penny. To be clear, we are not in the investment business. We are the \"lender of last resort.\" We do not think all or even most of you will survive this crisis, and we do not expect to make money on this transaction. We are angry that you did not conserve your cash for this rainy day, and if we did not have an economy to save and millions of Americans to help, we would just let you fail. \n\nIf you think you can get better terms from another investor, we encourage you to get them. We are offering you this lifeline because we benefit from having an airline industry and the jobs and services it provides. In this time of national crisis, we also do not think it is in our interests to let all of you go bankrupt at once. Thank you again for your request. We look forward to working with you.\n\nSincerely, \n\nThe American people",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, airline CEOs! We understand that you would like us to provide you with at least $54 billion so that you can avoid bankruptcy. Please understand that times are tough for us, too. Lots of us are getting hammered. Two years ago, our government enacted a corporate tax cut that saved you and other US companies hundreds of billions of dollars. This tax cut benefited you and your shareholders, but it also ballooned our annual government deficit to more than $1 trillion a year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the coronavirus now plunging our economy into recession, our tax revenue will tank, and our deficit will skyrocket even more, perhaps to $2 trillion or $3 trillion per year. So we&amp;#39;re not as flush as we should have been. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you know well your business is cyclical. So cyclical in fact that many of you have already gone bankrupt in the past. So you could have saved this cash for a rainy day. But you didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although the coronavirus pandemic is bad luck, it was not unforeseeable. In fact, at least one of your members, American Airlines, explicitly foresaw it. In recent financial filings, American cited &amp;quot;outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior&amp;quot; as a major risk to its business. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, while we sympathize with your plight, please understand that we&amp;#39;re not going to just &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; you the money. You and your shareholders and lenders knew the risks you were taking, and, for more than a decade, you enjoyed the rewards. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, you aren&amp;#39;t the only ones who need our help. Just ask the cruise lines, hotel companies, and restaurants, bars, gyms, and other establishments in so many of our American communities that have been forced to close altogether —as well as the millions of Americans who will soon be laid off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, your $54+ billion bailout will be structured as follows: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior, secured credit line that will allow you to borrow the money you need to operate and pay your taxes while you figure out how to survive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This credit line will pay interest at a rate that compensates taxpayers for the use of our money and the risks we are taking. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The use of this credit line will also require you to issue equity to taxpayers to allow us to share in your recoveries, if any. Yes, this equity issuance will dilute your shareholders and cause your stock prices to drop. But not as much as they will if you go bust. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our credit line, moreover, will be senior to all of your other debt and secured by your airplanes and other assets. If, despite our help, you fail, we will sell your airplanes and recoup 100 cents on our dollars before any of your other lenders get a penny. To be clear, we are not in the investment business. We are the &amp;quot;lender of last resort.&amp;quot; We do not think all or even most of you will survive this crisis, and we do not expect to make money on this transaction. We are angry that you did not conserve your cash for this rainy day, and if we did not have an economy to save and millions of Americans to help, we would just let you fail. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think you can get better terms from another investor, we encourage you to get them. We are offering you this lifeline because we benefit from having an airline industry and the jobs and services it provides. In this time of national crisis, we also do not think it is in our interests to let all of you go bankrupt at once. Thank you again for your request. We look forward to working with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The American people&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
